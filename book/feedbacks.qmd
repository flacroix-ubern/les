# Earth system feedbacks  {#sec-feedbacks}

## Land as an element in the Earth system

The Earth system can be regarded as a coupled system in which its elements (atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere,  biosphere, lithosphere) interact on various time scales. A primary goal of Earth System research is to understand the interactions occurring on time scales that are relevant for society in the context of anthropogenic climate change. It is now established with overwhelming evidence that anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels have caused a rise in atmospheric concentrations beyond levels reached over the past 800,000 years, and that this concentration increase is the dominant driver of climate change as observed over the last decades [@IPCC_2021_WGI_TS].

Any prediction of climate change in the coming decades, centuries and millennia relies on an understanding of the processes that are key to the following questions: 

- How fast will anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions and other greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere?
- How does the anthropogenic modification of the biosphere through land use change affect greenhouse gas emissions by land ecosystems, land-climate interactions, and the carbon cycle?
- What is the climate response to changes in atmospheric CO~2~ and other drivers? 
- What mechanisms does the rise in CO~2~ and the change in climate set in motion and how do they feed back to climate change?

The land carbon cycle, emissions of several greenhouse gases, and various land surface properties respond to a changing climate and atmospheric CO~2~. The processes responsible for the climate and CO~2~ effect on land ecosystems were introduced in Part I of this book. For example, rising CO~2~ has a fertilising effect on photosynthesis (@sec-fvcb). Rising temperatures accelerate respiration by autotrophs (e.g, plants) and heterotrophs (e.g., microbes and fungi) (@sec-carboncycle_ecosystem) and may shift photosynthesis beyond its temperature optimum (@sec-ftemp). Increasing temperatures drive water loss through evapotranspiration and, potentially aggravated by reduced precipitation, can reduce root zone water availability and induce hydraulic stress in plants (@sec-hydraulics), reduced CO~2~ uptake by photosynthesis (@sec-transpiration), and can trigger tree mortality.

The climate and CO~2~-driven responses of land ecosystems and land surface processes affect the C balance of the terrestrial biosphere (its net biome productivity, @sec-nbp) and, through altered surface properties, land-climate interactions, e.g., through altered albedo and conductances to land-atmosphere water vapour fluxes (@sec-landclimate). While Part I of this book introduced the processes by which climate and CO~2~ affect the terrestrial biosphere, the land carbon cycle and land-climate interactions, Part II looks at how this affects the climate system. In addition to the focus on C, energy, and water, Part II extends the scope to the nitrogen (N) cycle, how it affects the C cycle and how emissions of the important greenhouse-gas N~2~O are controlled. Methane (CH~4~), an even stronger contributor to climate change than N~2~O, also has major sources in land ecosystems. Wetlands and fire are natural sources of CH~4~ and respond sensitively to climate change. Because greenhouse gases and land surface properties affect climate and are affected by it, *feedbacks* arise.

A feedback arises when the output to a process triggers an amplification (positive feedback) or an attenuation (negative feedback) of the initial input.

Greenhouse gas emissions from land ecosystems and modifications of land-climate interactions are also the response of a direct anthropogenic *forcing* that would arise also in absence of changes in climate and CO~2~. For example, deforestation leads to a loss of C stored in biomass (and respective CO~2~ emissions) and to a modification of the surface radiation balance [@bala07pnas], nitrogen fertiliser inputs drive enhanced nitrous oxide (N~2~O) emissions [@galloway04], and wetland drainage leads to C loss from soils and associated CO~2~ emissions, but also reduces CH~4~ emissions [@fluet23nat]. To complicate things, human alterations of the land surface and ecosystems also modify the feedbacks between terrestrial systems and climate. For example, deforestation reduces the capacity of the terrestrial biosphere to act as a C sink for anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions. These myriad interactions make the land an intricately coupled element of the earth system and call for a conceptual framework and formalism for separating feedbacks and forcings and measuring their strengths.

## The terrestrial biosphere in equilibrium

A useful staring point is to consider the terrestrial biosphere and the Earth system being in a dynamic equilibrium (@sec-preindustrialcarboncycle). The terrestrial biosphere being in equilibrium with climate and atmospheric CO~2~ is an approximative concept often used as a description for its pre-industrial state. It is motivated by the finding that atmospheric CO~2~ [@siegenthaler05; @macfarling06grl] and climate were remarkably stable during the pre-industrial Holocene (ca. 11 ka BP -- 1750 AD) and that the terrestrial carbon (C) and nutrient balances and other ecosystem properties (greenhouse-gas emissions, surface energy and water exchange, see @fig-bonan) adjust to perturbations and re-equilibrate on time scales of decades to millennia. These time scales are determined by vegetation dynamics and related shifts in carbon and nutrient cycling (decades to centuries), and the relatively slow turnover times of soil organic matter pools (centuries to millennia). We learned about the dynamics of carbon cycling in ecosystems in @sec-carboncycle_ecosystem. 

The equilibrium concept implies that no net C fluxes occur between the terrestrial biosphere, the ocean and the atmosphere, and that all other properties remain constant. The relatively balanced state of the C cycle during the pre-industrial Holocene is remarkable in the view of the vast C reservoirs on land and the large gross exchange fluxes (@sec-globalcarbonbudget). Globally, ca. 130 PgC yr^-1^ are assimilated by terrestrial photosynthesis (gross primary production, GPP), and ca. 60 PgC yr^-1^ are retained to assimilate vegetation biomass (net primary production, NPP). The vegetation C stock amounts to ca. 450 PgC and is turned over on time scales of years (grass, leaves) to decades (wood). Decomposed litter feeds soil C stocks (ca. 1700 PgC), where it is retained for centuries to millennia, and is ultimately respired back to the atmosphere as CO~2~ through heterotrophic respiration (*R*~h~). Peatland C stocks (ca. 600 PgC, @yu10grl) have even longer lifetimes due to anaerobic soil conditions inhibiting decomposition. The turnover time (lifetime) of a given C reservoir determines its time scale of response to a perturbation (@sec-ccascade). Large C stocks are contained in permafrost soils (ca. 1200 PgC, including yedoma and deltaic deposits, @tarnocai09gbc) where C is practically locked away from the C cycle but can be re-mobilised upon thawing. @fig-carbon-pools-fluxes-ipcc provides an schematic overview of these global C pools and fluxes.

Note that on millennial time scales, the C cycle has only very minor long-term sinks (e.g., oceanic sediment burial, peat buildup), and that any perturbation of the equilibrium induces a *redistribution* of C within the different reservoirs. Until equilibration, net fluxes between reservoirs occur mostly in the form of gaseous CO~2~. In contrast, other greenhouse-gases (e.g., N~2~O , CH~4~) have considerable sinks in the atmosphere and, to a lesser degree, in soils. Thus, net land-to-atmosphere and ocean-to-atmosphere fluxes persist also in a C cycle equilibrium and maintain atmospheric concentrations.

The concept of a land C cycle equilibrium during the pre-industrial Holocene is approximate because *(i)* climate and CO~2~ conditions were not perfectly stable but responded to volcanic activity, changes in solar radiation, and slow changes in orbital configurations @wanner08qsr, *(ii)* anthropogenic land use change has had profound impacts on local ecosystem functioning since the emergence of agriculture at the turn of the Neolithicum and caused significant global impacts on the carbon cycle and climate probably as early as ca. 1000 BC [@stocker17pnas], *(iii)* a small net C sink in peatlands has persisted even millennia after their establishment at the end of the Last Deglaciation due to the extremely slow turnover rates of soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions [@yu10grl], *(iv)* dynamics of permafrost buildup are likely to evolve on multi-millennial time scales as well, implying long-term disequilibrium fluxes, and *(v)* a small burial flux of terrigenous organic matter in inland lakes and coastal zones causes a continuous sink of C.

## The terrestrial response to the anthropogenic perturbation

The pre-industrial "equilibrium" has been dramatically perturbed since fossil energy sources have been used and have enabled the rapid rise of the global economy and industrial production. The CO~2~ emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels has accumulated in different reservoirs of the land and ocean carbon cycle (@fig-carbon-pools-fluxes-ipcc) and has wide ranging consequences for climate, ocean acidification, primary productivity of the biosphere, and the cycling of nutrients. The industrialisation has been accompanied by an increase in global population, a shift in consumption patterns and a growing demand for food. The associated expansion of agricultural land  has transformed ca. 30% of the land surface [@ramankutty08gbc] and ca. 24% of the total terrestrial net primary production is appropriated by human uses [@vitousek86biosci; @haberl07pnas]. The production of mineral fertilisers, necessary to support today's agricultural output, has fundamentally disrupted the natural nutrient cycles and has amplified soil N~2~O emissions [@galloway04]. This has led to the accumulation of an array of radiatively active substances in the atmosphere and has contributed to anthropogenic climate change, eutrophication of ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, and impacts on human health. 

The human-caused accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the increase in other forcing agents is measured by the additional energy input into the climate system as the *effective radiative forcing* (ERF, @fig-radiative-forcing). The ERF is measured as an energy flux in W m^-2^ and reflects the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and their effectiveness in heating the atmosphere over a given time period - here 1750-2019. The influence of *forcing agents* on the Earth's energy balance, e.g., the albedo change caused by land use change, can similarly be measured in terms of its ERF. @fig-radiative-forcing provides an overview of the ERF of different forcing agents since 1750. Among these, CO~2~, CH~4~, N~2~O, and albedo are tightly linked to land processes. The effect of greenhouse gases plays out through their absorption of longwave radiation that would otherwise radiate back into space. Instead, the radiative energy is absorbed and the trapped energy contributes to heating air. The radiative effect of albedo changes play out through the energy balance of the Earth surface (@sec-landclimate).

## Climate forcings from the terrestrial biosphere {#sec-terrforc}

The terrestrial biosphere acts as a forcing element in direct response to anthropogenic land use (LU) and land use change (LUC), N~r~ -deposition, and air pollution (tropospheric ozone, O~3~^tropos^ ; sulphate deposition, etc.). For example, fertilising agricultural soils with reactive N and atmospheric deposition (N~r~, refers to all reactive mineral N species, most importantly NH~y~ , NO~x~, and N bound in organic compounds.) causes an increase in N~2~O emissions. Global net land use change (LUC) - that is the net of deforestation, afforestation, reforestation, and land abandonment across different regions globally - causes net CO~2~ emissions (@sec-gcb). Fires associated with human activities emit a range of reactive N species, CH~4~, aerosols, and CO~2~. Air pollution, e.g., tropospheric ozone, reduces photosynthesis and thus affects the land C balance [@sitch07nat]. Hence, as a consequence of the anthropogenic forcing, land ecosystems emit radiatively active compounds and affect the surface-atmosphere energy exchange. 

Conceptually, we can consider these influences of human activities as *external forcings* on land and the resulting perturbation of the Earth's energy balance as a *radiative forcing*. As a simplification, we can consider that the strength of these forcings is not directly affected by any other state variable of the Earth system. In @fig-schematic_fb_frc, external forcings are indicated by yellow boxes and arrows. Note that the majority of radiative forcings result from direct emissions (not via affecting terrestrial processes) of greenhouse gases (CO~2~, CH~4~, HFCs), aerosols, and reactive gases that affect the lifetime of greenhouse gases (CO affects the atmospheric lifetime of CH~4~).


## Feedbacks from the terrestrial biosphere {#sec-terrfb}

Emissions drive atmospheric concentrations and atmospheric concentrations determine the radiative forcing and thus climate. Land-climate feedback loops arise via the atmospheric concentration of CO~2~ - which affects photosynthesis and thus the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems - and via climate - which affects land processes and thereby the emissions of greenhouse gases and albedo (@fig-schematic_fb_frc). The change in climate and CO~2~ caused by the external forcings drive an additional response of land-mediated biogeochemical and biogeophysical forcing agents and the final change in climate is the combined outcome of the initial external forcing and the feedbacks. 

::: {.callout-note}

### Quantifying feedbacks with an Earth System Model

In the context of Earth system modeling, the "forcing part" of land-mediated changes can be assessed by considering the radiative forcing and climate change (global mean surface temperature change, $\Delta T^\text{ctrl}$ in @fig-radiative-forcing-stocker13) in a simulation setup where changes in climate and CO~2~ are *not* communicated to the land model component. In contrast, a feedback is triggered by the perturbation of climate and CO~2~, feeding back to modify land-mediated forcing agents. The final climate change considering forcings and feedbacks is measured by the global mean temperature change in the respective simulation ($\Delta T^\text{CT}$ in @fig-radiative-forcing-stocker13). Including the feedbacks requires a coupled Earth system model setup where the land module "sees" changes in climate and CO~2~. The "feedback part" is then captured by the difference of the coupled and un-coupled simulations.

:::

Climate-land feedbacks are a subset among a larger number of climate feedbacks that operate also in the atmosphere, ocean, and the cryosphere. A climate feedback is commonly defined as a process that drives a change of the energy balance of the climate system as a function the global mean temperature. A positive climate feedback drives an additional energy input, while a negative climate feedback drives an additional energy loss. A discrete set of such climate feedbacks are commonly distinguished [@fig-feedbacks-ipcc-ts]. 

### The most important physical climate feedbacks {#sec-climatefeedbacks}

**Planck response**  The energy emitted by the Earth (or any material body) through longwave radiation scales with $T^4$ - with the fourth power of the temperature of the emitting body. Therefore, as the Earth's atmosphere heats up, its loss of radiative energy increases rapidly. The Planck response is therefore a negative feedback and, reflecting the fourth power, it is a particularly strong negative feedback.

**Water vapour plus lapse rate**  More water vapour can be contained in warmer air, following the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Greater vapour content leads to more longwave and shortwave radiation to be absorbed, and this effect is greatest in the upper troposphere (over the tropics). Hence, the additional atmospheric warming reduces the lapse rate and increases the radiation of the warmed troposphere into space. The water vapour feedback alone is positive and strong, while the lapse rate feedback alone is negative and less strong. Since they act in combination, they are commonly quantified as a single feedback. Their combined effect is still a strong positive feedback.

**Surface albedo**  Increasing temperatures reduce sea ice and seasonal snow cover - on land and on sea ice. This reduces the albedo (@sec-albedo) and thus increases the absorption of solar radiation  at the surface and decreases its reflection into space. Hence, the surface albedo is a positive feedback.

**Clouds**  Different types of clouds exhibit different responses to warming and lead to different effects on the Earth's energy balance. The uncertainty of this feedback is particularly high.

### Biogeochemical climate feedbacks {#sec-bgcfeedbacks}

The land and ocean carbon responses to climate and to CO~2~ are commonly distinguished. The responses to CO~2~ induce relatively strong negative feedbacks, but their uncertaintly is large, particularly for the land carbon response to CO~2~. This uncertainty reflects open questions regarding the CO~2~ fertilisation effect on terrestrial carbon storage (@sec-sink). Increasing atmospheric CO~2~ also drives CO~2~ uptake by the ocean (@sec-oceancarbon), leading to a negative feedback. The response to climate induce positive feedbacks - a relatively weakly positive one through the ocean response, and a stronger positive but highly uncertain one through the land response. The positive feedback of ocean carbon to climate arises due to the reduced solubility of CO~2~ in warmed ocean water and reduced ocean mixing in a warm climate. The positive feedback of land carbon to climate arises due to a multitude of processes acting on plant physiology (@sec-ftemp), hydraulic stress through increased vapour pressure deficit of a warmer atmosphere (@sec-hydraulics), tree mortality, enhanced autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration (@sec-carboncycle_ecosystem), and the loss of permafrost (@sec-permafrost). Some land carbon responses to climate also induce negative feedbacks, e.g., the temperature-driven northward expansion of the boreal treeline and associated arctic greening [@keenan18natcc].

Weaker feedbacks arise through additional biogeochemical processes, most importantly through emissions of CH~4~ and N~2~O [@stocker13natcc], but also through reactive gases that affect the lifetime of CH~4~ in the atmopshere [@arneth10natgeo]. Chapter @sec-ghg will focus on these non-CO~2~ greenhouse gases.

The strengths of the feedbacks depend on the state of Earth and on the dominant radiative forcing agents that drive the temperature change. For example, if there was no terrestrial biosphere, the positive feedback of land carbon to climate and the negative feedback to CO~2~ would both be zero. If ecosystems that are currently responsible for the CO~2~ fertilisation effect were lost, then the respective negative feedback would be reduced. In other words, protecting ecosystems that are particularly valuable in the context of mitigating the anthropogenic CO~2~ rise, serves to maintain the strong negative feedback of the land carbon cycle to CO~2~. It should also be noted that the quantification of the land and ocean carbon cycle to CO~2~ feedback strength shown in @fig-feedbacks-ipcc-ts refers to changes in the context of anthropogenic climate change, where the rise in CO~2~ is the dominant driver. For a change in global mean temperature induced by non-CO~2~ forcing agents, the respective negative feedbacks would be accordingly smaller. However, due to the tight coupling of climate and atmospheric CO~2~ also over glacial-interglacial cycles, the negative feedbacks to CO~2~ were at play also in in other climate change contexts.

In view of the large C stocks in permafrost and the potential large-scale soil waterlogging and associated CH~4~ emissions in regions of melting permafrost, the respective climate feedback is potentially strong. However, uncertainties are large (as shown in @fig-feedbacks-ipcc-ts) and effects of different processes induce both positive and negative feedbacks. For example, the melting of permafrost can cause additional - previously frozen - soil organic matter to be decomposed. This leads to additional CO~2~ emissions and a positive feedback to climate. Melting permafrost also enables the northward expansion of the boreal forest biome which leads to increasing C storage in woody biomass and thus to a negative feedback via the carbon balance, but potentially to an additional positive feedback via the associated albedo change. An increase in CH~4~ emissions from waterlogged soils in permafrost regions causes a positive feedback to climate. The permafrost feedback has received also popular attention as an example of a positive climate feedback [@yaffa22newyorker] and a separate box was devoted for it in Chapter 5 of the IPCC AR6 (Box 5.1, @IPCC_2021_WGI_Ch_5). The example of the permafrost climate feedback illustrates the complexity of the land response to climate where a plethora of different processes induce opposing radiative effects, to a varying degree in different regions across the globe.



<!-- The context of anthropogenic climate change since the industrial era implies large changes in atmospheric CO~2~ . In a narrower sense as outlined in @sec-fbmaths}, feedbacks are triggered only by the change in global mean temperature ($\Delta T$ in Equation @eq-fbpaper). However, the uptake of anthropogenic CO~2~ by land and ocean is commonly treated as a negative feedback @gregory09jclim, since increases in atmospheric CO~2~ are an inherent feature and the dominant cause of anthropogenic climate change. In future climate change scenarios, the strength of this negative feedback is thus ultimately determined by the relative share of CO~2~ versus non-CO~2~ forcings (see @sec-sensitivities}). -->

<!-- @arneth10ngeo provided a comprehensive overview of different feedbacks from land ecosystems and estimated rough values for their strength. @ciais13ipcc updated this compilation with different model estimates which have become available since then. According to these results, the positive feedback from permafrost thaw may have a particularly strong effect in amplifying climate change. Results presented in @sec-multiGHG}, in line with @arneth10ngeo, suggest that climate feedbacks from the terrestrial biosphere are dominated by the negative feedback from the CO~2~ -induced land C sink, and the positive feedback from the temperature-driven land C source. However, this assessment did not include effects of permafrost thaw and assumed a constant extent of wetlands based on present-day observations, which primarily affects the feedback from wetlands CH~4~ emissions. Chapter @sec-topmodel} presents the development of a model that dynamically simulates the spatial extent of wetlands and peatlands in response to variations in climate and CO~2~ , an important mechanism for predicting the CH~4~ feedback @melton13. Results presented in @sec-multiGHG} further indicate that today, the negative land C sink feedback is dominating and that under a business-as-usual future climate change scenario, the negative total feedback will decline due to saturating sinks and decreasing radiative efficiency of CO~2~ under high concentrations. -->

<!-- A strong terrestrial C sink has been observed over the past decades (1.5$\pm$1.1, 2.7$\pm$1.2 and 2.6$\pm$1.2 PgC yr^-1^ for the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s) @ciais13ipcc. This corresponds to 25 to 35\% of total anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions. These numbers are directly linked to LUC emission estimates and their uncertainty since they are commonly derived as the difference of the total terrestrial C balance and LUC emissions. However, C sink estimates are also supported by an atmospheric inversion @gurneyeckels11, and by process-based models @lequere13essd. The latter study provides a thorough account of updated results and applied methodologies for the quantification of the present-day C budget. The land's role in absorbing fossil fuel CO~2~ emissions and the interannual variability of this sink is impressively illustrated by @fig-cbudget. -->

<!-- The mechanisms behind the land C sink are not well constrained. Short-term (year-to-year) variability of the atmospheric CO~2~ growth rate is to a large degree determined by the interannual variability of the terrestrial sink which, in turn, has been related to ENSO @raupach08, and volcanic activity @mercado09. This relationship has been used as a constraint for global vegetation model's sensitivity of C storage to climate change @cox13, and has been interpreted as an indication that tropical forest dieback - a positive climate feedback previously suggested as a tipping element in the system @lenton08, - poses less of a threat than suggested by some of the models. Using such global scale observations as an ``emergent constraint'' for models is promising since field studies are generally limited to examining small scale ecosystem processes, while the interplay between different processes and the extrapolation of findings to the global scale often remain elusive.  -->

<!-- Our own results illustrate the effect of uncertainty in climate projections on the land C sink. Depending on the magnitude (global mean) and the spatial pattern of predicted climate change under a future business-as-usual scenario, the land will turn into a sizable net C source (160 PgC) or remains largely neutral with respect to C storage (see Figure 3.c, @stocker13natcc, Chapter @sec-multiGHG}). A recent inter-comparison of coupled Earth system models revealed a considerable spread of results with regard to how much additional C will be sequestered in land ecosystems by the end of the 21st century @arora13. To a large degree, this uncertainty appears to be related to the land C cycle response itself. How can processes responsible for the C sink be constrained? What processes are responsible for this sink? The persistence of the negative feedback from the terrestrial C sink depends on its response to the combination of climate change and CO~2~ increase and the validity of projections of the sink strength into the future rests on the process understanding determining the currently observed sink flux. Therefore ... -->

<!-- ### Why the sink? {#sec-sink} -->

<!-- A range of mechanisms have been discussed to explain the current land C sink. CO~2~ fertilisation, relief of nitrogen limitation by increased N~r~ deposition @norby98, thornton07, zaehledalmonech11, thomas10}, forest regrowth and afforestation, changes in forest management and reduced harvest rates @nabuurs13, and the lengthening of the growing season in temperature limited ecosystems probably all play a role, but their relative contribution remains debated. The sink induced by N~r~ -deposition has been quantified at 0.2-0.4 PgC yr^-1^ by a range of observation-based estimates and modeling studies @nadelhoffer99, liugreaver09, thomas10, zaehledalmonech11}, but uncertainties remain with regard to the C:N ratio of the sink (see @sec-ncycle}).  -->

<!-- Above all, CO~2~ fertilisation of photosynthesis and gross primary productivity (GPP) is the main suspect for driving the sink. Improved light use efficiency of photosynthesis under elevated CO~2~ enables enhanced CO~2~ fixation rates @haxeltine96, potentially leading to more C being stored in plant biomass and soil organic matter. Criticism has been raised concerning the link between changes in GPP and the change in C storage. While models commonly assume that turnover times of individual reservoirs do not depend on CO~2~ and GPP, it has been suggested that subtle shifts in the tree age distribution, disturbance regimes, and tree mortality may have an overriding effect on the terrestrial C balance, compensating for the stimulation of GPP @koerner09. Such effects are not captured by Dynamic Global Vegetation Models, the main working horses in the quantification of the land carbon budget. -->

<!-- Increased water use efficiency of C3 photosynthesis and associated C3 trees' competitive advantage over C4 grasses likely contributes to the positive response of GPP under elevated CO~2~ . In manipulative field experiments, this effect accounted for a large part of the positive NPP response; it has been suggested as the main driver of observed ``woody thickening'' and ``greening'' in water-stressed ecosystems @donohue13, wigley10}, and is key to explaining the large reconstructed expansion of tropical forests over the Last Deglaciation @bragg13, when CO~2~ was rising from 190 ppm to 260 ppm @monnin01. Such observational evidence from a real ecosystem responding to a large and long-term CO~2~ rise appears to lend unique support for the CO~2~ -fertilisation hypothesis. -->

<!-- Free Air CO~2~ Enrichment (FACE) experiments investigate the ecosystem response under conditions that are presumably the closest equivalent to a natural ecosystem responding to rising CO~2~ . Only few such studies have been realized to date. @norby05 documented a robust initial enhancement of NPP by 23\% across a broad range of productivity. The responses diverged after several years and declined to 9\% seven years after the start of the experiment at one site @norby10, while it was sustained at another site @drake11. Declining N availability was argued to progressively limit the initial positive response @norby10. @finzi07 also pointed out the crucial role of the N cycle in determining the persistence of the positive response to CO~2~ , and showed that either increased N uptake or better N use efficiency supported the positive NPP response over several years. -->

<!-- The key importance of C and N cycle interactions has also become evident in the context of the argument about C sink projections by C4MIP models @friedlingstein06. These models have been used for carbon cycle projections as presented in the IPCC's AR4 @denman07ipcc, but do not include terrestrial N cycling. @hungate03 argued that such models' prediction of 350-890 PgC sequestered by 2100 AD in a  CO~2~ -only model setup (no climate change) would have to be countered with an uptake of 7.7 to 37.5 PgN, assuming a constant C:N ratio in trees and soils. They further argued that their estimated possible range of future N supply of 1.2 to 6.1 PgN sets a hard upper limit for C sequestration and that the models' C sink predictions are therefore not plausible. This warrants a closer look at what processes determine the cycling of N in land ecosystems in the following Section.  -->

<!-- ## The terrestrial nitrogen cycle {#sec-ncycle} -->

<!-- Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for the assimilation of biomass where N is required in a relatively constant ratio to C (C:N ratio), depending on the type of tissue. Furthermore, N is required in high amounts for rubisco, the enzyme responsible for CO~2~ fixation. C:N ratios are around 31$\pm$7 in herbaceous biomass, 169$\pm$43 in wood, and are as low as 15-20 in humic substances in the soil @esser11. Although C:N ratios within these pools are more flexible than the rigid Redfield ratios in oceanic living organisms, they appear to vary little also under changing environmental conditions @norby01. Any increase in the size of the C pool in the terrestrial biosphere has thus to be countered with a respective uptake and immobilisation of N in organic material. However, due to low atmospheric N inputs, high energetic costs to acquire reactive N, and the continuous and (partly) unavoidable losses, N is often limiting in ecosystems. -->

<!-- An increasing terrestrial C stock requires either that N inputs have to exceed N losses, and/or a shift of C sequestration to pools with a high C:N ratio. Otherwise, the assimilation and immobilisation of additional N induces a decline in inorganic soil N and ultimately sets an upper limit to C sequestration. Will such a "progresive nitrogen limitation" (PNL) @luo04, limit the C sink? And what mechanisms determine N inputs and losses? -->

<!-- ### Nitrogen inputs -->

<!-- N cycles through terrestrial ecosystems in gaseous forms (N~2~ , NO~x~ , NH~3~ ), dissolved in the soil solution (NO~3~, NH~4~ ), or bound in organic compounds. The atmospheric N$_2$ reservoir is practically inexhaustible but due to the high energy requirement to break its triple-bond and convert it into reactive forms, it is like the ocean's salty water to a human dying of thirst. Ecosystems have evolved mechanisms of biological N fixation (BNF) to convert N$_2$ under high energetic requirements into reactive forms, available for the assimilation of organic material. BNF is done as a symbiosis of plants (mostly leguminoses) with soil bacteria (e.g., rhizobium), in free-living soil bacteria (cyanobacteria, heterotrophs, autotrophs) @vitousek02, or by cryptogamic covers @elbert12. In the pre-industrial era, BNF was quantitatively the main pathway of N accrual by ecosystems. Today, this may still be the case only for pristine ecosystems, not affected by the increased N~r~ -deposition @cleveland99. Global estimates of BNF are associated with large uncertainties and have been quantified to be between 100 to 290 TgN yr^-1^ @cleveland99, with a recent ``trend'' towards the lower end (40 to 100 TgN yr^-1^) and a ``best estimate'' of 58 TgN yr^-1^ @vitousek13. BNF is generally viewed as being resource-intensive and is limited by low levels of available energy, high levels of N~r~ in the soil, and low availability of other nutrients (phosphorous, iron, potassium, molybdenum) @vitousek13. -->

<!-- N also enters ecosystems directly in reactive forms (N~r~ ) through atmospheric deposition (preindustrial ca.30 TgN yr^-1^) and lightnings (ca.5 TgN yr^-1^) @galloway04. In the atmosphere, N~r~ has a short  lifetime (hours - days) @galloway03, and the main sink is depostion, mostly on land @dentener06. N~r~ sources to the atmosphere are NO~x~ emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, NO~x~ , N~2~O , and NH~3~ from wildfires, and NO~x~ , NO, NH~3~, and N~2~O from  soils. In agricultural regions, ammonium (NH~4~ ) is the dominant form of N~r~ and originates from agricultural NH~3~ emissions. Since the invention of the Haber-Bosch process in the 1920s to convert N~2~\ into ammonium, the increase in fossil fuel burning, and the widespread cultivation of N$_2$ fixing crops, the anthropogenic production of N~r~ has soared (156 TgN yr^-1^) and now outweighs natural terrestrial BNF @galloway04. This N~r~ enters land ecosystems either directly via mineral fertilisers on croplands (today ca.100 TgN yr^-1^, @galloway04 zaehle11ngeo}), or indirectly via atmospheric deposition (today ca.65 TgN yr^-1^, @galloway04 lamarque11cc}).  -->

<!-- ### Nitrogen losses {#sec-nlosses} -->

<!-- N is lost from ecosystems through microbial denitrification, leaching, volatilisation, the removal of biomass by harvest, and fires. Microbial processes have evolved to gain energy by oxidizing or reducing N compounds. Volatile forms, produced by these transformations, may be lost to the atmosphere. Leaching along hydrological pathways affects dissolved organic N (DON), nitrate (NO~3~ ) and nitrite (NO~2~ ) and generally increases with increasing N~r~ inputs @ena. N bound in biomass may also be removed from the system via harvest on managed lands, and fires associated with the emissions of a range of different N species (N~2~ , NO~x~ , N~2~O , NH~3~ ) @ena. -->

<!-- Gaseous N losses via microbial processes broadly scale with the size of N~r~ pools in the soil @esser11, while the loss rates are governed by soil environmental conditions. Denitrification is the main loss pathway of N~r~ and occurs under oxygen-limited, anaerobic conditions. It is governed by the availability of NO~3~ and labile C as a energy-providing substrate for the redox-process and shows a strong temperature response, partly owing to the enzymatic response but also due to increased anaerobiosis as a result of amplified heterotrophic activity under higher temperatures @butterbachbahl11. @seitzinger06 suggested that 40\% of the total N~r~ input of 270 TgN yr^-1^ (natural plus anthropogenic) is lost via denitrification and that nearly half of this ocurrs in freshwater systems. However, using data on ecosystem $\delta^{15}$N, @houltonbai09 estimated the total denitrification N loss to be much lower (28 TgN yr^-1^). -->

<!-- Nitrification is the biological oxidation of NH~4~ or NH~3~ . It affects how much N~r~ is lost due to the susceptibility of end-products (NO~3~ and NO~2~ ) to hydrological leaching and further reduction and gaseous loss via denitrification. The fact that NH~4~ is preferentially taken up by plants over NO~3~ adds to that @ena. Note that the end-product of nitrification itself (NO~3~ ) is still in a reactive form, for which reason nitrification is usually not referred to as a N~r~ loss pathway. Nitrification occurs in well-aereated soils but is limited by low soil moisture @barnard05. Under high soil pH, loss as NH~3~ can become important and NH~3~ is mainly emitted from agricultural soils with high inputs of animal manure and/or urea. -->

<!-- In general, the rate of N~r~ loss in gaseous, as well as leached forms, is an indicator for ecosystem N status @davidson07, ena}. Under increasing N scarcity, more N~r~ is retained and the ratio of internal recycling versus losses (in equilibrium balanced by inputs) is high. Such conditions occur, e.g., during forest stand development after abandonment of agricultural land on highly weathered tropical soils @davidson07. When N~r~ becomes increasingly available, the N cycle becomes more "leaky", or more "open", and losses increase @barnard05. The anthropogenic acceleration of N cycling by the dramatic increase in ecosystem N~r~ inputs induces a more leaky N cycle and amplifies N~r~ losses. -->

<!-- @galloway03 have documented how every molecule of N~r~ lost can cause a range of detrimental environmental effects as it is transformed within and transported between different landscape elements. The critical step is the initial formation of N~r~ . In the atmosphere, NO~x~ and NH~3~ contribute to aerosol formation and tropospheric ozone. N~2~O acts as a greenhouse-gas and depletes stratospheric ozone. An increasing amount of N~r~ is transferred to the hydrosphere (wetlands, rivers, estuaries), causes eutrophication and acidification and is converted back to N$_2$ by denitrification with a fraction lost as N~2~O to the atmosphere. This N cascade thus has consequences for biodiversity, human health and climate.   -->

<!-- ### Carbon and Nitrogen cycle interactions determine N availability and uptake {#sec-cncoupling} -->

<!-- A plant's demand for N is driven by the growth in different stores with their respective C:N ratios and is limited by the availability of N. While the ecosystem N balance is governed by inputs and losses, a plant's actual N availability under natural conditions is to a large degree determined by the decomposition (and mineralisation) rate of litter and soil organic matter. While the "classic" N cycle paradigm centers on the mineralisation rate as the bottleneck-process governing N limitation, more recent research has documented the uptake of organic N (monomers and amino acids) @nasholm98,schimel04,nasholm09} and views N uptake in the light of a plant's resource economics @fisher10, phillips13}. This view suggests, that under increasingly N limited conditions, a plant's allocation of C dynamically adjusts to improve its access to N (and other nutrients).  -->

<!-- Indeed, allocation to root growth has been documented to increase under elevated CO~2~ and N limitation @pregitzer08, iversen12, vangroenigen11}. Contrarily, fine root mass decreased in a warming experiment, where increased soil turnover improved N availability @melillo11. Access to N not only depends on root mass and the soil exploration by fine roots, but also on the efficiency of mycorrhizal fungi in providing mineral N to the plant. Mycorrhiza live in association with the plant and have a more efficient access to mineral N (arbuscular mycorrhiza) than roots alone and can even access organic N (ectomycorrhiza). They satisfy their energetic demands from labile C exuded by the roots @phillips13. Thereby, fungal, as well as microbial activity, fuelled by readily available energy from exuded labile C, induces a "priming effect" of (otherwise recalcitrant) soil organic matter @fontaine07, cheng13, drake11}. This not only mobilises N but also affects the soil C balance. -->

<!-- Also N~2~\ fixation has been suggested as a costly facultative plant strategy, deployed under N-scarce conditions, but omitted when N is abundant @hedin09, barron11}. The same principle applies on the ecosystem level, where plants capable of fixing N have a competitive advantage under strong N limitation but are outcompeted when N is abundant. This dynamic adjustment of processes responsible for overcoming ecosystem N deficiency and making N available for plant uptake has been documented for forest stand development in tropical ecosystems after disturbance @davidson07, yang11, batterman13}. Whether these mechanisms may prevent a "progressive N limitation" under rising CO~2~ and relieve the observed N shortage after the initial NPP stimulation in FACE experiments remains to be shown. -->

<!-- While the effect of C-N interactions on the terrestrial response to CO~2~ is unclear, the response to warming appears more robust. Accelerated decomposition mobilizes N @bai13, and alleviates N limitation in temperate and boreal ecosystems. In a soil warming experiment, this led to an initial negative soil C balance, compensated later by a stimulation of plant growth due to the release of additional inorganic N from soil organic matter decomposition @melillo11. -->

<!-- Atmospheric deposition of reactive N generally attenuates N shortage, induces a reduction of plants' investments into N uptake and frees resources to invest into the access to other limiting factors (e.g., light). This has a positive effect on C sequestration @magnani07, thomas10}. Trees with arbuscular mycorrhizal associations have been shown to benefit most from increased inorganic N pools under elevated N~r~ deposition @thomas10. But how much additional C is stored for each N added? @magnani07 suggested a large N~r~ -deposition driven C sink with seemingly no detrimental effect under even the highest observed deposition rates. Their calculation implied a C:N ratio of 470 for this sink. A high value, that was later critisized and corrected downwards. Accounting for bulk (including dry) N~r~ deposition alone would decrease the value by @magnani07 to 175 @devries08. Regarding the C:N ratios of plant pools and assumptions on allocation patterns of sequestered C reduces the ratio further to 30-70@devries08, sutton08, thomas10}. Plot-level $^{15}$N tracer experiments show that most N is retained in soils, where C:N ratios are even lower @nadelhoffer99, liugreaver09}. The strong positive effect of N~r~ deposition on C sequestration suggested by @magnani07 has also been critisized due to their neglection of a possible upper limit @deschrijver08. Ecosystem N oversaturation under continuous high N~r~ inputs increases NO~3~ leaching and can thereby lead to soil acidification with detrimental effects on plant growth and may turn ecosystems into a source of C @ena. -->

<!-- The N cycle differs markedly between natural and agricultural ecosystems @ena, butterbachbahl11}. N cycling on agricultural land is governed by fertilizer N inputs and harvest N removal, while on non-agricultural land, it is determined by the subtle balance of inputs by N~r~ -deposition and BNF and the losses. The pools of inorganic N is increased on managed land by the application of fertilisers and on non-agricultural land by N~r~ -deposition. This over-supply negatively affects N retention processes and induces an amplification of N losses and associated N~2~O emissions (see @sec-n2o}). E.g., @barton99 showed that denitrification rates are one order of magnitude higher on agricultural land than in forests. While climate and CO~2~ are inducing gradual changes in the cycling and the stocks of N in terrestrial ecosystems, direct anthropogenic impacts thus have an overriding effect via controlling ecosystem inputs of N~r~ @butterbachbahl11.  -->

<!-- ### Nitrogen limitation controls N~2~O emissions from soils {#sec-n2o} -->

<!-- Atmospheric N~2~O concentrations have increased from ca.270 to ca.320 ppb since pre-industrial times @meure06, and now contribute about 7.4\% to the total anthropogenic radiative forcing @ciais13ipcc. N~2~O has an atmospheric lifetime of about 122 years and has its sink in the troposphere where it also contributes to ozone depletion @hirsch06gbc. Today, the relative share of terrestrial to total (including oceanic) N~2~O emissions is roughly 64-74\% @hirsch06gbc. Atmospheric inversions cannot constrain this split more precisely and suggest global emissions of 14.1-17.8 TgN yr^-1^\footnote{Numbers reported here refer to the mass of N~2~O -N.} @huang08, in line with a top-down estimate of 15.7$\pm$1.1 TgN yr^-1^ @prather12. Bottom-up estimates have a much higher uncertainty  (8.1-30.7) TgN yr^-1^ with a ``best'' estimate of 17.9 TgN yr^-1^ @ciais13ipcc. -->

<!-- Over Glacial-Interglacial cycles, as well as with millennial-scale climate variability (Dansgaard-Oeschger events), atmospheric N~2~O varied between ca.220 and ca.280 ppb @schilt10qsr. While @schmittnergalbraith08nat suggested that the N~2~O changes related to millennial-scale climate variability during the last Glacial (Dansgaard-Oeschger events) can be fully explained by oceanic source changes, land modeling studies found a considerable positive feedback between terrestrial N~2~O emissions and climate @xuri12nphyt, stocker13natcc} (see also Chapter @sec-multiGHG}), which likely contributed to the variations of atmospheric concentrations on these time scales. -->

<!-- Land sources of N~2~O are denitrification and nitrification by bacteria, archaea, and fungi in soils. Along the nitrification pathway, where NH~3~ is oxidized to NO~3~ , N~2~O is produced as a by-product. Under denitrification, NO~3~ is sequentially reduced to NO~2~ , NO, N~2~O , and N$_2$, the latter being most reduced form. The ratio of volatile losses of N~2~\ versus N~2~O depends on the soil oxygen status @simek02. In the reduction of NO~3~ , denitrifying bacteria rely on labile C as a source of energy. Given the control of N limitation on root exudation of labile C, this represents a possible negative feedback on N shortage. -->

<!-- Under natural conditions, soil N~2~O emissions are often reported to be driven by high soil temperatures and to peak at soil moisture levels of around 70\% water-filled pore space @davidson91, schilt10qsr}. This has been interpreted that N~2~O emissions ``essentially depend on precipitation and temperature and are therefore closely linked to climatic changes'' @fluckiger04. However, apart from the variable ratio of N lost as N~2~O versus N~2~ , N~2~O emissions are primarily governed by the amount of N denitrified and nitrified, thus ultimately by the size of the inorganic N pools. Soil moisture and temperature exert a control solely by modifying the nitrification/denitrification {\it rates}, while oxygen availability determines the loss pathway (denitrification versus nitrification). The size of the inorganic N pool can be viewed as a measure for N limitation. Under N scarcity, inorganic N availability decreases and N tends to be retained within the system, rather than being lost. Hence, N~2~O emissions decrease with increasing N limitation and vice versa @davidson07. -->

<!-- How does climatic change affect N limitation? The decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is generally accelerated under warmer soil temperatures @knorr05. In a N-limited temperate ecosystem, a soil warming experiment found that the faster SOM decomposition alleviates N limitation by releasing more inorganic N and results in an enhanced above-ground tree growth after 7 years @melillo11. However, the effect on N losses and N~2~O emissions were not reported and ultimately depend on the subtle balance between changes in decomposition and N mobilisation rates and changes in N demand and uptake by stimulated growth. Meta-analyses found that elevated CO~2~ had a positive, or no significant effect on N~2~O emissions, and relatively large uncertainties remain @vangroenigen11.\\  -->

<!-- In agricultural soils and in ecosystems affected by enhanced anthropogenic N~r~ inputs, N limitation is relieved and N~2~O emissions increased @barnard05. This direct anthropogenic impact has an over-riding effect on N~2~O emissions, dominating the more subtle responses to changes in climate and CO~2~ under natural conditions @barnard05, butterbachbahl11}. The fraction of N~r~ added that is lost as N~2~O is commonly referred to as the N~2~O emission factor and quantified at 1\% @IPCC2006, to 5\% @crutzen08atmchemphys,davidson09natgeo}. Our own results presented in @sec-multiGHG} suggest that the effect of climate and CO~2~ in controlling N~2~O emissions from agricultural soils are substantial and might amplify this N~2~O emission factor in a high-warming scenario. Thus, terrestrial N~2~O emissions as a ``climate feedback element'' might gain in importance relative to terrestrial N~2~O emissions being primarily a ``climate forcing'' controlled solely by anthropogenic N~r~ inputs.  -->

<!-- ## N cycle representations in global vegetation models {#sec-nmodels} -->

<!-- A range of global vegetation models simulating the coupled cycling of carbon and nitrogen have been presented since the multi-model carbon cycle projections in the IPCC AR4 @denman07ipcc. These models differ with respect to the implementation of particular N cycle processes, as well as in their focus on which processes are resolved in what detail. No concerted model inter-comparison of this generation of models has been conducted to date. However, @zaehledalmonech11, provide a thorough account of available models and their individual implementations. Here, I will briefly touch upon some of the features which, in my view, are key to generating long term N limitation and determining the long-term C sink. @sec-dyn} then provides a brief description of the N cycle implementation in DyN-LPJ, the ``template'' for LPX-Bern, the model applied for the studies presented in this thesis. -->

<!-- As discussed in @sec-cncoupling}, the long-term effect of C-N coupling on terrestrial C sequestration is primarily controlled by the balance of N losses and inputs and whether N can be retained under N limitation or whether more N can be made accessible either through upscaling BNF or mining additional SOM to satisfy the increasing demand. On the input side, some models @zaehle10ocn1, jain09} formulate BNF as being constant based on climatic variables. This is likely to lead to conditions of progressive N limitation. On the other extreme, BNF scales with plant productivity and should thus tend to satisfy an increasing demand @xuri08gcb, thornton07}. Resource limitation on the capacity of plants to acquire N through BNF, a concept with strong observational support (see @sec-cncoupling}), is treated only by few models @fisher10, esser11, gerber10}. Interestingly, one such model suggests no long-term N deficiencies under elevated CO~2~ with 8.5 PgN additional BNF @esser11. This is beyond the upper limit of total additional N inputs suggested by @hungate03. Explicit interactions with the rhizosphere through labile C exudation and energy limitation of SOM decomposition is not implemented in any global model. -->

<!-- On the loss side, simple representations are based on a hole-in-the-pipe approach, where a constant fraction of mineralized N is lost @gerber10, wang10}. This implies that N losses are independent of N limitation and the size of inorganic N pools. Thus, no N retention mechanism is at play, unless N is retranslocated within the plant before leaf abscission @fisher10. More sophisticated parametrisations of nitrification and denitrification explicitly treat a varying inorganic N pool @thornton07, and few @zaehle10ocn1, xuri08gcb} have adopted simplified versions of complex site-scale models (DNDC-type, @li00) where nitrification, denitrification, leaching, and volatilisation are simulated with an explicit treatment of the most relevant substrate pools (NO~3~ , NO~2~ , NO, NH~3~ , labile C). These models are also able to capture effects on N~2~O emissions assuming constant ratios of N lost as N~2~O versus N~2~ . To date, only O-CN @zaehle10ocn1, and LPX-Bern @stocker13natcc, have been applied to simulate the dynamics of C and N cycling, effects on N~2~O emissions, and their feedback with climate and the carbon cycle.  -->

<!-- Observational evidence for flexible C:N stoichiometry is somewhat inconclusive @norby01, finzi07, norby05}, potentially causing considerable uncertainty in C sink projections. Most models assume a constant C:N ratio in individual plant pools, and few allow for flexibility within constraints @xuri08gcb, restricted elasticity @zaehle10ocn1, or by the buffering of short-term fluctuations in N availability by a temporary storage pool @gerber10. However, small changes in C:N ratio over the 21st century are predicted by one model which allows for flexibility @esser11. -->

<!-- Key results of this generation of global vegetation models are that (i) the positive response of terrestrial C storage to CO~2~ is reduced, and that (ii) land C losses caused by warmer temperatures are attenuated. The latter effect is found in all models and is due to the additional N released by enhanced SOM decomposition, an effect robustly backed by observational studies @melillo11. C-N effects on the response to CO~2~ show a large spread, probably due to the models' different implementations of mechanisms determining N limitation. The C sequestration by 2100 AD is reduced by effects of C-N interactions by 31\% in O-CN @zaehle13, by 74\% in CLM-CN @thornton07, and by less than 10\% in LPX-Bern.  -->

<!-- ## N cycle representation in DyN-LPJ {#sec-dyn} -->

<!-- The DyN-LPJ (Dynamical Nitrogen cycle-LPJ) by @xuri08gcb has been adopted in LPX-Bern to capture C-N coupling effects, soil inorganic N dynamics and associated N~2~O emissions. This is a further development of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model LPJ-DGVM @sitch03gcb. Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) represent not only terrestrial C (and N) cycling but also the vegetation dynamics based on plant functional types (PFTs) in response to climate. A full account of the equations and parameter values implemented in DyN-LPJ is provided in the original publication @xuri08gcb. @fig-dyn serves as a graphical illustration and represents the most important flows, stocks, and transformation processes of N in DyN-LPJ. A documentation of the adoption of DyN-LPJ into LPX-Bern and the necessary modifications is provided in Appendix @sec-app.lpx}. This version of LPX-Bern (version 1.0) has been used in @stocker13natcc to quantify different feedbacks between land and climate (see Chapter @sec-multiGHG}).\\  -->

<!-- Dynamics of soil inorganic N are resolved in DyN-LPJ with relatively high process detail following a scheme of DNDC-type (@li00, see @sec-nmodels}). On the other hand, its C-N coupling can be loosely described as ``weak''. E.g., inputs of N (a surrogate for all types of BNF) indirectly scale with plant productivity, as the soil C:N ratio is held constant and an implicit N influx is governed by the soil C inputs from litter decomposition  (see @fig-dyn). Although on the short term, N limitation can occur as N uptake is limited by the availability of inorganic N, the system tends to bring in additional N on the long-term when productivity is enhanced (e.g., under elevated CO~2~ ). In DyN-LPJ, soil temperature and soil moisture govern N availability which can induce N limitation under cold temperatures. Compared to the C-only model setup (in LPX-Bern), this leads to significantly reduced productivity and C stocks at high northern latitudes and required some adjustments to bring soil stocks back to better agreement with observations (see Appendix @sec-app.lpx}). -->

N uptake is driven by the N demand and limited by the availability of inorganic N (NH~4~ , NO~3~ ), temperature, and soil moisture (not shown). The N demand is determined by NPP and the constant C:N ratio of new tissue. NPP is downscaled so that the demand is met by the availability.

<!-- Generally put, N limits C sequestration in DyN-LPJ on the short-term, and predominantly via temperature. Elevated CO~2~ stimulates NPP and ultimately the turnover of litter and SOM. This releases more N~r~ and amplifies N~2~O emissions. The effect of N~r~ -deposition is weak for C sequestration as the model tends not to be N limited. Thus, N~r~ additions primarily increase the inorganic N pools with direct effects on N losses and N~2~O emissions. These model characteristics are reflected in published results @xuri12nphyt, stocker13natcc} and in @fig-betagamma, @sec-multiGHG}.  -->

<!-- DyN-LPJ and LPX-Bern results can be compared to the results of the O-CN model presented in @zaehle11ngeo.

In LPX-Bern, this effect is almost negligibly small (see @fig-betagamma). Respective observational studies tend to support the findings by @zaehle11ngeo. On the other hand, O-CN simulates small effects of 20th century-climatic change and CO~2~ increase on N~2~O emissions. LPX-Bern and DyN-LPJ suggest a positive response to both drivers, in line with findings of a meta-analysis of observational studies @vangroenigen11, and compatible with atmospheric growth rate changes during the 20th century @xuri12nphyt.

## Forcings vs. feedbacks

The mathematical formalism explained in the blue box below provides a conceptual distinction between forcings and feedbacks. It is often not straight-forward to separate them, especially in an observational setting. In a Earth system model simulation, they can be separated either by uncoupling model components (see @fig-radiative-forcing-stocker13), or by regressing the Earth's top-of-atmosphere energy flux against the global mean surface temperature. In the example illustrated by @fig-toa_fb, the atmospheric CO~2~ concentration is doubled instantaneously. Through the greenhouse effect of CO~2~, this induces an energy imbalance of the Earth, leading to a net radiative energy flux at the top-of-atmosphere. Over time, the combined effect of all feedbacks in the Earth system lead to a re-equilibration of the energy balance (zero energy imbalance) and to an adjustment of the global mean surface temperature. The points in @fig-toa_fb illustrate the trajectory of this re-equilibration. Their regression line can be used to determine the *climate sensitivity* to a doubling of CO~2~ (the x-axis intercept), the effective radiative forcing of a doubling of CO~2~ (the y-axis intercept), and the climate feedback parameter (the slope), representing the sum of all feedbacks operating in the Earth system.

## Feedback formalism {#sec-concepts}

It is often challenging to disentangle the energy input by the radiative forcing from the change in the energy input through the feedbacks. In an Earth system modeling context, this separation can be achieved by coupling and de-coupling model components (see Box above). This section introduces a framework for the quantification of climate feedbacks, based the published literature [@friedlingstein06jclim; @gregory09jclim; @roe09annrev] and by the IPCC AR6 in Chapter 7 [@IPCC_2021_WGI_Ch_7].

Consider the Earth's climate to be a system responding to a radiative forcing $F$ with a radiative response $H$, so that in equilibrium, the net energy flux into the system $N$ is zero and no warming or cooling occurs.
$$
N = F - H\;,\; N = 0 \; \Rightarrow \; F = H
$$

Observations confirm that $H$ can be linearized with respect to the temperature change $\Delta T$ [@gregory09jclim], so that

$$
F = \lambda \cdot \Delta T %\; \Rightarrow \; \lambda = \frac{F}{\Delta T}
$$ {#eq-climatesensitivity}

$\lambda$ is the climate feedback factor given in W m^-2^ K^-1^ and is equal to the inverse of the climate sensitivity factor. $\lambda$ is thus the basic quantity to describe the temperature change of the climate system in response to a given radiative forcing. However, $\lambda$ summarizes all feedbacks that operate in the Earth system. To quantify an individual feedback, we define a reference system, in which the feedback of interest is not operating. The most basic reference system is to consider the Earth as a Black Body. @fig-radiative-forcing-stocker13 illustrates the case where the reference system considers no feedbacks from the terrestrial biosphere in which the radiative forcing $F$ leads to a temperature change $\Delta T^{\text{ctrl}}$ ("ctrl" refers to 'control').

$$
F = \lambda_0 \cdot \Delta T^{\text{ctrl}}
$$ {#eq-fb0}

Here, $\lambda_0$ is the sum of all climate feedbacks that that operate in the reference system. In our case, these are the feedbacks that are not mediated through land processes, including feedbacks from the Black Body response or Planck feedback (BB), water vapor (WV), albedo ($\alpha$), lapse rate (LR), cloud (C), ocean carbon (OC), etc.

$$
\lambda_0 = \lambda_{\text{BB}} + \lambda_{\text{WV}} + \lambda_\alpha + \lambda_{\text{LR}} + \lambda_{\text{C}} + \lambda_{\text{OC}} + \; ... 
$$

Note that in our reference system, the terrestrial biosphere is still affected by external forcings (land use, N~r~ inputs), which leads to terrestrial greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions and albedo change, eventually affecting $\Delta T^{\text{ctrl}}$.

When a feedback is included, the system adjusts to a different temperature $\Delta T$ because it now "sees" an additional energy input triggered by the feedback. E.g. a warmer climate stimulates terrestrial N~2~O emissions which increase its atmospheric concentration and lead to additionally absorbed energy due to its greenhouse effect. In the framework of climate feedbacks, this additional energy input (or loss) is always expressed as being proportional to the global mean surface temperature ($\Delta T$). Note however that in reality, the energy gain/loss is not necessarily linear with respect to $\Delta T$. For example, the energy loss through the Planck response scales with $T^4$. However, considering temperature variations in the context of anthropogenic climate change, this response can be linearised and expressed as a linear function of $\Delta T$ - as is done for all climate feedbacks.

Let us now look at "land" as a feedback element in the climate system, interacting via a multitude of feedbacks. We summarize these as $r_{\text{land}}$. The additional energy loss/gain ($\Delta F$) through all land-mediated feedbacks combined are expressed as a linear function of $\Delta T$: 
$$
\Delta F = r_{\text{land}} \cdot \Delta T
$$
$r_{\text{land}}$ is the strength of all land feedbacks combined, is expressed in W m^-2^ K^-1^ - consistent with the values shown in @fig-feedbacks-ipcc-ts. It is positive for positive feedbacks. This additional energy gain/loss is considered separately and in addition to the initial radiative forcing $F$ in @eq-fb0. When included, it yields $\Delta T$ (instead of $\Delta T^\text{ctrl}$ when not considering land feedbacks)

$$
F + r_{\text{land}} \cdot \Delta T = \lambda_0 \cdot \Delta T 
$$ {#eq-fb1}

It is common to use the negative of $r$ ($\lambda = -r$) for expressing the climate feedback factor as the sum of its components. Accordingly:
$$
F = ( \lambda_0 + \lambda_{\text{land}}) \; \Delta T \;.
$$ {#eq-fbpaper}

@eq-fb1 can be rewritten as
$$
\Delta T = \frac{F}{\lambda_0} + \frac{r}{\lambda_0}\;\Delta T\;,
$$

This illustrates mathematically that the feedback arises because a fraction $f=\frac{r}{\lambda_0}$ of the system output $\Delta T$ is fed back into the input. 

We can take a different perspective and characterise the effect of a feedback with the *gain factor* $G=\frac{\Delta T}{\Delta T^{\text{ctrl}}}$. By combining Equations @eq-fb0 and @eq-fb1, the gain factor becomes

$$
G=\frac{\Delta T}{\Delta T^{\text{ctrl}}} = \frac{\frac{F}{\lambda_0-\lambda_0f}}{\frac{F}{\lambda_0}} = \frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda_0-\lambda_0f} = \frac{1}{1-f}
$$

Note that $f=\frac{r}{\lambda_0}$ is sometimes referred to as the 'feedback factor', but not here, where the feedback factor is $r = -\lambda$. The advantage of the formulation of Equation @eq-fb1 and @eq-fbpaper is that individual feedbacks can be added to derive their combined effect.

$$
F = ( \lambda_0 + \sum_i \lambda_{\text{i}} ) \; \Delta T\;.
$$

Note that $f=\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\sum_i r_{\text{i}}$ and that $G\neq\sum_i G_{\text{i}}$.

### Feedbacks versus sensitivities {#sec-sensitivities}

The strength of feedbacks as quantified by the feedback factor $r$ is determined by the vigour of the cause-and-response chain depicted in @fig-radiative-forcing-stocker13. Feedback factors can be derived as the product of the sensitivity of greenhouse-gas emissions to temperature ($\partial e\text{GHG}/\partial T$), the sensitivity of atmospheric concentrations to emissions ($\partial c\text{GHG}/\partial e\text{GHG}$), and the sensitivity of the radiative forcing to a change in atmospheric concentrations ($\partial F/\partial c\text{GHG}$).

$$
r = \frac{\partial e\text{GHG}}{\partial T} \times \frac{\partial c\text{GHG}}{\partial e\text{GHG}} \times \frac{\partial F}{\partial c\text{GHG}}
$$ {#eq-fbtrad}

This is a simplification because it neglects that concentrations are also a function of the sinks (not only emissions), which in turn depend on other factors (e.g., $\Delta T$ in the case of CH~4~ ). Furthermore, the $r$ quantified from observations and model simulations in the context of anthropogenic climate change implies that GHG emissions not only reflect the response to changes in climate ($\Delta T$) but also to changes in atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations (cCO~2~), and that $\Delta T$ is a function of cCO~2~ and other forcing agents. To account for the CO~2~-driven (negative) feedbacks, the sensitivity of GHG emissions to cCO~2~ ($\partial e\text{GHG}/\partial c\text{CO}_2$) has to be included:

$$
r = (\frac{\partial e\text{GHG}}{\partial T} + \frac{\partial e\text{GHG}}{\partial c\text{CO}_2} \times \frac{\partial c\text{CO}_2}{\partial T} )\times \frac{\partial c\text{GHG}}{\partial e\text{GHG}} \times \frac{\partial F}{\partial c\text{GHG}}\;\,
$$ {#eq-fbext}

where $\partial c\text{CO}_2/\partial T$ is determined by the share of the non-CO~2~ forcing in the climate change scenario from which $r$ is derived.

In the literature [@friedlingstein06jclim; @gregory09jclim; @roe09annrev], sensitivities of terrestrial C storage ($\Delta$C) to cCO~2~ and climate are often referred to as $\beta$ and $\gamma$ and are directly linked to feedback factors that would arise if the carbon cycle would respond only to atmospheric CO~2~ ($r_{\Delta\text{C}}^{\text{C}}$) and the feedback factor that would arise if the carbon cycle would respond only to climate ($r_{\Delta\text{C}}^{\text{T}}$).

$$
  \beta_{\Delta\text{C}}  = \frac{\Delta \text{C}}{\Delta c\text{CO}_2} \sim r_{\Delta\text{C}}^{\text{C}}
$$

$$
  \gamma_{\Delta\text{C}} = \frac{\Delta \text{C}}{\Delta T}            \sim  r_{\Delta\text{C}}^{\text{T}}
$$

Such $\beta$ and $\gamma$ sensitivities can be quantified also for other forcing agents and can be derived from offline (land-only) simulations by regressing C storage and other GHG emission changes to prescribed temperature or atmospheric cCO~2~. Thus, more generally:

$$
  \beta  = \frac{\partial e\text{GHG}}{\partial c\text{CO}_2} \sim r^{\text{C}}
$$
$$
  \gamma = \frac{\partial e\text{GHG}}{\partial T}            \sim  r^{\text{T}}
$$

Estimates for $\beta$ and $\gamma$ can then be used to calculate feedback factors $r^{\text{CT}}$ without having to rely on coupled land-climate models. However, assumptions have to be made.:

  - For the conversion of an emission change to a change in concentrations ($\partial c\text{GHG}/\partial e\text{GHG}$), equilibrium of atmospheric concentration after the perturbation of emissions is usually assumed. For greenhouse-gases with a long atmospheric lifetime (e.g., N~2~O ), such an equilibrium is only reached on time scales of centuries after a stabilisation of emissions. Feedback factors are often quantified from transient siemulations where no equilibrium is reached yet, and thus represent *transient feedbacks*. For $\Delta$C and associated terrestrial CO~2~ emissions, no such equilibrium can be defined as the airborne fraction of a perturbation $\Delta c\text{CO}_2/\Delta e\text{CO}_2$ depends on the time scale of interest.
  - Relatively simple functions can be applied for $\partial F/\partial c\text{GHG}$ to convert a concentration change into a radiative forcing [@joos01gbc]. However, the non-linearity of these functions implies that the background (initial) concentration has to be defined. In other words, the radiative forcing of a unit greenhouse gas concentration declines at high concentrations and thus reduces the respective feedback factor.
  - Feedback factors $r$ are expressed with respect to $\Delta T$, while values are often derived from observational records where cCO~2~ co-varied with $\Delta T$ [@tornharte06]. Thus, derived values for $r$ are subject to the share of CO~2~ versus non-CO~2~ forcings (scenario dependence), as expressed by $\partial c\text{CO}_2/\partial T$ in @eq-fbext.
  - Atmospheric sink processes of greenhouse gases may depend on climate. This inhibits a linear and constant relationship between emissions and concentrations.

Feedback factors $r$ have the advantage that the feedback strengths of different forcing agents to different drivers (climate and cCO~2~ ) have the same units (Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$) and can be compared. However, Earth system state-dependency and the contribution of CO~2~ to the radiative forcing complicates the comparison of values derived from different simulations and observations. $\beta$- and $\gamma$-sensitivities are more robust in that respect as they are normalised to the change in temperature and cCO~2~ individually, but their different units prevent a comparison of their relative importance in the coupled Earth system.
