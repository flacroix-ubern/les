               carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, thereby slowing the increase of
               CO2 concentration in the atmosphere1. Year-to-year variations in
               the atmospheric CO2 growth rate are mostly due to fluctuating
               carbon uptake by land ecosystems1. The sensitivity of these
               fluctuations to changes in tropical temperature has been well
               documented2--6, but identifying the role of global water
               availability has proved to be elusive. So far, the only usable
               proxies for water availability have been time-lagged
               precipitation anomalies and drought indices3--5, owing to a lack
               of direct observations. Here, we use recent observations of
               terrestrial water storage changes derived from satellite
               gravimetry7 to investigate terrestrial water effects on carbon
               cycle variability at global to regional scales. We show that the
               CO2 growth rate is strongly sensitive to observed changes in
               terrestrial water storage, drier years being associated with
               faster atmospheric CO2 growth. We demonstrate that this global
               relationship is independent of known temperature effects and is
               underestimated in current carbon cycle models. Our results
               indicate that interannual fluctuations in terrestrial water
               storage strongly affect the terrestrial carbon sink and
               highlight the importance of the interactions between the water
               and carbon cycles. The growth rate of global atmospheric CO2
               concentration is faster in drier years, independently of
               temperature; this relationship is underestimated in current
               carbon cycle models.",

  abstract = {RECENT results1,2 from two ice cores drilled in central Greenland have revealed large, abrupt climate changes of at least regional extent during the late stages of the last glaciation, suggesting that climate in the North Atlantic region is able to reorganize itself rapidly, perhaps even within a few decades. Here we present a detailed stable-isotope record for the full length of the Greenland Ice-core Project Summit ice core, extending over the past 250 kyr according to a calculated timescale. We find that climate instability was not confined to the last glaciation, but appears also to have been marked during the last interglacial (as explored more fully in a companion paper3) and during the previous Saale–Holstein glacial cycle. This is in contrast with the extreme stability of the Holocene, suggesting that recent climate stability may be the exception rather than the rule. The last interglacial seems to have lasted longer than is implied by the deep-sea SPECMAP record4, in agreement with other land-based observations5,6. We suggest that climate instability in the early part of the last interglacial may have delayed the melting of the Saalean ice sheets in America and Eurasia, perhaps accounting for this discrepancy.},

  abstract = {Last Glacial millennial-scale climate variability transitioned through distinct cold stadial and warm interstadial states. Here we use Earth system model simulations to demonstrate that nonlinear self-sustained climate oscillations appear spontaneously within a window of glacial-level atmospheric CO2 concentrations ({\textasciitilde}190–225 parts per million). Outside this window, the system remains in either quasi-stable cold low CO2 or warm high CO2 states, with infrequent and abrupt random transitions driven by noise. In the oscillatory regime, the time between climate transitions is governed by temporal variations in the state of the ocean, atmosphere and sea ice, with CO2 acting as a control on the relative rates of the internal forcing and feedback in the system. The Earth system model results map perfectly to a slow–fast dynamical systems model, where the fixed point of the system transitions into the oscillatory regime through a loss of stability at two critical tipping points, the window boundaries. The deterministic component of the oscillations is modified by a stochastic element associated with internal climate variability. Agreement between observations and the hierarchically disparate models suggests the existence of an internal stochastic climate oscillator, which tracks variations in atmospheric CO2 level through the glacial, acting in concert with noise-induced transitions.},

  abstract = {The simplest possible model is proposed to explain a large fraction of the millennial climate variability measured in the isotopic composition of Antarctic ice cores. The model results from the classic bipolar seesaw by coupling it to a heat reservoir. In this “thermal bipolar seesaw” the heat reservoir convolves northern time signals with a characteristic timescale. Applying the model to the data of GRIP and Byrd, we demonstrate that maximum correlation can be obtained using a timescale of about 1000–1500 years. Higher correlations are obtained by first filtering out the long-term variability which is due to astronomical and greenhouse gas forcing and not part of the thermal bipolar seesaw. The model resolves the apparent confusion whether northern and southern climate records are in or out of phase, synchronous, or time lagged.},
