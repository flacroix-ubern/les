  abstract  = "Land ecosystems absorb on average 30 per cent of anthropogenic
               carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, thereby slowing the increase of
               CO2 concentration in the atmosphere1. Year-to-year variations in
               the atmospheric CO2 growth rate are mostly due to fluctuating
               carbon uptake by land ecosystems1. The sensitivity of these
               fluctuations to changes in tropical temperature has been well
               documented2--6, but identifying the role of global water
               availability has proved to be elusive. So far, the only usable
               proxies for water availability have been time-lagged
               precipitation anomalies and drought indices3--5, owing to a lack
               of direct observations. Here, we use recent observations of
               terrestrial water storage changes derived from satellite
               gravimetry7 to investigate terrestrial water effects on carbon
               cycle variability at global to regional scales. We show that the
               CO2 growth rate is strongly sensitive to observed changes in
               terrestrial water storage, drier years being associated with
               faster atmospheric CO2 growth. We demonstrate that this global
               relationship is independent of known temperature effects and is
               underestimated in current carbon cycle models. Our results
               indicate that interannual fluctuations in terrestrial water
               storage strongly affect the terrestrial carbon sink and
               highlight the importance of the interactions between the water
               and carbon cycles. The growth rate of global atmospheric CO2
               concentration is faster in drier years, independently of
               temperature; this relationship is underestimated in current
               carbon cycle models.",
