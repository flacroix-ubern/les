# Biogeography

## A global view of vegetation

We start with the observation that the global distribution of plants and characteristic assemblies of different plant species is not random, but relates to climate. Around the beginning of the 19th century, Alexander von Humboldt pursued expeditions to different places on Earth and connected the multitude of his local observations into a global view of biogeography. He was the first to realise that vegetation zones along elevational gradients were shifted across different mountain ranges on different continents and located on different latitudes, and that the elevational and latitudinal patterns in vegetation were related to climate - in much the same way across the earth. This finding is visualised by the schematic scientific drawing in @fig-humboldt. The figure illustrates, for example, that the treeline increases from the high northern latitudes of Lapland at 68$^\circ$N to the Alps and Pyrenees at 42-46$^\circ$N and to the Himalaya at 29-32$^\circ$N. Or that the elevation at which *Betula alba* (birch) grows varies from 1000-2000 ft in Lapland, to 4000-5000 ft in the Alps, and about 15,000 ft in the Himalaya. @fig-humboldt also illustrates that the treeline doesn't increase monotonically with decreasing latitude. Although not spelled out in the figure, this is a hint at the importance of water, along with temperature, for controlling vegetation. We'll revisit this observation later in this book. Humboldt's integration of globally distributed observations into his global view of climate as a driver of vegetation was pioneering and forms the basis of our modern approach to understanding and modelling global vegetation patterns and how they are influenced by climate change.

## Biomes

Today's geodata provides information on climate and vegetation properties with global coverage. This enables a global mapping of vegetation, filling in the blank spots between the local observations made by Alexander von Humboldt 200 years ago. Global patterns in the distribution of vegetation become apparent when grouping plants and *plant functional types* (see XXX) into *biomes* or broad vegetation classes. A global map of biomes following the definition and global delineation by @olson01biosci is given in @fig-biomes_olson. The exact delineation and naming of biomes varies between different sources, but the main distinctions are shared among all of them.

```

Each biome is characterised by the types of dominant plants (plant functional types), their characteristics (traits), ecosystem structural and functional properties, and landscape processes (e.g., fire). Underlying all of this is the characteristic climate. The following biome classification (based on @bonan and slightly deviating from @olson01biosci) can be made.

::: {.callout-note}
Click on the biome names below to open a tab that lists some key characteristics and provides a Walter-Lieth climate diagram for a representative site, located in that biome. The sites are locations where ecoystem water and carbon fluxes, along with meteorological variables, are measured. We will revisit data from these same sites in later chapters, then with a focus on water and carbon fluxes and the phenology. The locations of the sites are indicated on the map below.

Walter-Lieth climate diagrams show monthly climatologies of average temperature and precipitation on the same axis and scaled such that months where the blue curve (precipitation, mm month^-1^) is above the red curve (temperature, $^\circ$C) indicates humid periods and the opposite relative curve positions indicates dry periods. Dry periods are roughly indicating when potential evapotranspiration is higher than precipitation (see also Chapter XXX). Blue bars along the x-axis indicate months with likely frost. Annotations on the top of the graph indicate the observation period (left), the mean annual temperature (center), and the mean annual precipitation (right). The average temperatures of the warmest and coldes months are given to the left of the temperature axis.

### Biomes in climate space

@fig-biomes_olson shows biomes in geographical space - as a global map. Acknowledging their intricate relationship with climate, biomes can also be delineated in climate space - in a diagram defined by mean annual temperature (MAT) along one axis and mean annual precipitation (MAP) along the other axis. This yields a plot following @whittaker75. Note that the biome definition shown in @fig-biomes_whittaker does not exactly match the definition of biomes given above as it is mainly aimed at separating with respect to MAT and MAP. For example, Mediterranean forests are not separated in the "Whittaker-plot". This is because their characteristic climate is not distinguished by annual means, but by the *seasonality* of temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation.

### Plant functional types

Each biome is characterised by a typical assembly of *plant functional types* (PFT). PFTs are a grouping of plant species based on their key physiological, morphological, and life history characteristics. That is, we can distinguish between annual (mostly grasses and herbs) and perennial (mostly trees and shrubs) plants, between needle-leaved and broadleaved trees, and between deciduous and evergreen trees. A key physiological distinction can further be made between grasses following the C~3~ vs. the C~4~ photosynthetic pathway (see Chapter XXX). Thereby, the bewildering diversity of the animal kingdom can be reduced to a small set of PFT. A common categorisation distinguishes the following PFTs:

1. needle-leaved evergreen trees
2. broadleaved evergreen trees
3. needle-leaved deciduous trees
4. broadleaved deciduous trees
5. broadleaved annuals (herbs)
6. C~3~ grasses
7. C~4~ grasses

Global vegetation models use PFTs as their basic unit of distinguishing plants. The exact delineation of PFTs implemented in such models may vary from the list given above. Further distinctions may be made and are relevant in a global vegetation and carbon cycle modelling context. For example, only a relatively small subset of plants are known to associate with symbiotic nitrogen (N)-fixing bacteria that live in root nodules of the host plant ("N-fixing plants", see also Chapter XXX). This association is highly relevant for the N economy of the plant and its productivity and competitiveness under different levels of N availability.

Plants can also be distinguished into the botanical classification of *angiosperms* (flowering plants) and *gymnnosperms* (seed-producing plants that include conifers, cycads, and Ginkgo). The distinction between angiosperms and gymnosperms largely aligns with the distinction between needle-leaved and broadleaved plants (but see Ginkgo). The two groups not only distinguished by their phylogenetic heritage, but also by essential characteristics that relate to the efficiency by which they photosynthesise and transpire water. Angiosperm leaves typically exhibit higher photosynthesis and transpiration rates, and are thinner and shorter-lived than leaves of gymnosperms. These differences relate to differences in how the water transport system (plant hydraulics) is built. A larger number and a wider diameter of water transport organs in angiosperms enable a higher water conductivity - essential for sustaining higher photosynthetic rates than in gymnosperms.

### Traits

The physiological, morphological, and life history characteristics that distinguish PFTs determine their productivity and competitiveness in a given climate. Such characteristics are referred to as *plant functional traits*, or often just *traits*. Plant species can be described by a set of traits and a set of certain traits yields the distinction into PFTs described above: leaf habit (deciduous vs. evergreen), leaf form (needle-leaved vs. broadleaved), and the life history strategy distinguising annual vs. perennial. A range of additional traits are commonly described and investigated scientifically. Here, we will not consider additional ones. The concept of a plant functional trait is that it describes a largely immutable characteristic of a plant species that determines metabolic rates (photosynthesis, respiration) and their relationship to the abiotic environment (e.g., temperature), nutrient and water demand, and ultimately its demographic rates (growth, fecundity, mortality) and thus competitiveness.

Today’s global distribution of species and biomes (assuming no intervention by human land use and forest management) is the outcome of competition and thus reflects the combination of plant functional traits that optimises competitiveness of a species under the present-day climate. The distribution of biomes and PFTs is thus a direct reflection of the climate.

For example, whether a region is dominated by deciduous or by evergreen trees and forests is determined by the benefits and costs for a plant of maintaining leaves year-round. Evergreen trees benefit from the ability to photosynthesise and gain carbon around the year. For example, in Mediterranean regions, although light levels are lower in winter than in summer, ample moisture and non-negligible light enables evergreen trees to assimilate carbon also during winter months. However, leaves and needles of evergreen plants have to be built for lasting several years. Such leaves are typically much thicker than those of deciduous trees and thus require more carbon per unit leaf area for their construction. The leaf mass per unit leaf area is commonly referred to as the leaf mass per area, LMA, and is an important additional plant trait as it is directly linked to a plant’s carbon balance. Over the leaf lifespan, the initial high construction costs of high-LMA leaves are outweighed by the additional carbon assimilation during periods when deciduous trees shed their leaves. 

Leaf-shedding of deciduous trees, in contrast, is a strategy to avoid having to build costly long-lasting leaves and maintaining them year-round (which also incurs an additional respiration cost, also in the form of carbon). Leaves are shed during periods when the climate is unfavourable for photosynthesis - during cold and dark winter months, or during excessively dry periods.

Note that plant functional traits are often not entirely immutable. Instead, traits may vary also within a species and these variations are often driven by the environment. This is called *acclimation*. Such variations can even arise over the course of a season. For example, photosynthetic traits can rapidly acclimate to the large changes in light availability over the course of a year. Some traits are more plastic than others. For example, a tree is either needle-leaved or broadleaved. There is no continuum between the two leaf forms. In contrast, the nitrogen content per unit leaf mass is relatively plastic within a species.

A changing environment changes the competitiveness of a given species, i.e., of a given trait combination. As a result, some traits may acclimate to some extent within a weeks to years. Over longer time scales, the altered demographic rates in a new climate affect the competitiveness of a species (even after some of its traits may have acclimated to a new climate) and ultimately shift demographic rates and the community composition. In grasslands, where the demographic cycle is short, such community composition changes may unfold over time scales of a few years. In forests, the longevity of an individual tree is on the order of decades to centuries and community composition changes unfold on correspondingly long time scale. 

## Vegetation types

Note that the categorisation of vegetation into biomes is different from the categorisation of vegetation into *vegetation types* or land cover classes. A widely used distinction of vegetation types/land cover classes is that of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP). Vegetation types distinguish what can be seen from space and are thus amenable to remote-sensing based land cover classification. However, for example, different types of evergreen broadleaved forests are not distinguished (e.g., moist tropical, Mediterranean, and temperate evergreen broadleaved forests).

## Climate zones

While the biome categorisation is based on plant functional types and reflects a mix of vegetation types and climate, the categorisation into vegetation types is independent of climate, but purely based on vegetation and land cover properties that can be sensed from space. In contrast to this approach, we may focus exclusively on the climate and distinguish *climate zones* that largely align with the major biomes. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification [@koppen1884] is based on a hierarchical classification that separates climate based on values and the seasonality of monthly air temperature and precipitation. Water availability during the main vegetation periods and temperature minima during winter and maxima during summer are recognized to be particularly influential for the composition of the vegetation.

## Hillslope-scale heterogeneity

Topography shapes microclimates and drives small-scale variations in hydrology. In mountain regions, vegetation may thus vary strongly along small spatial scales - on the order of 10-10^3^ m. This scale - from the river channel to the ridge - is referred to as the *hillslope scale*. In much the same way as climate drives vegetation across biomes, so it does across the hillslope scale. The incident solar radiation and - as a consequence of that - near-surface air temperatures are affected by the local slope, aspect, and shading by the surrounding topography. Soil moisture and the groundwater table depth are affected by lateral subsurface flow of water, driven by gradients in water potentials along topographical gradients. Subsurface water flow converges in depressions and concave terrain (e.g., in valley bottoms) and diverges in convex terrain. (e.g., on ridges and hilltops). As a consequence, the water table is shallow in valley bottoms and deep under ridges. Radiation and hydrology thus create microclimates and plant water availability conditions that are shaped by topography and variations in vegetation that are shaped by the microclimates and hydrological conditions. 

These hillslope-scale variations "intersect" with the the background climate (average climate across larger spatial scales, on the order of 10^4^-10^5^ m). A shallow groundwater table and moist soils in valley bottoms can promote plant productivity in arid regions and seasons. In contrast, in a humid climate, a very shallow water table in valley bottoms inhibits plant productivity due to anaerobic conditions in waterlogged soils and the inability of roots to penetrate into permanently water-saturated soil. Similarly, the influence of radiation in promoting versus inhibiting plant productivity depends on the background climate. In cold climates of the high northern latitudes, the solar zenith angle is relatively high, also in mid-summer. This creates a strong influence of the local slope and aspect. In the northern hemisphere, south-facing slopes receive more radiation - a difference to north-facing slopes that can be critical for sustaining tree growth in high northern regions. In contrast, elevated incident solar radiation in south-facing slopes can aggravate water limitation and suppress vegetation productivity in more arid climates of the subtropics and mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere.

Climate also varies along elevation due to thermodynamics and radiative transfer in the atmosphere - independent of the slope and aspect of the local terrain. Temperatures decline following the lapse rate in the troposphere, leading to a shift of vegetation zones along elevational gradients. This phenomenon is depicted also in Humboldt's drawings (@fig-humboldt). Radiation levels are elevated at high altitudes due to a shorter path length and thus reduced absorption by the atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and thus the partial pressure of oxygen declines with elevation. This implies reduced respiration and an increased efficiency of photosynthesis. 

Small-scale variations in vegetation may also be driven my variations in soil characteristics and bedrock lithology which influences drainage and soil chemistry (pH, nutrient availability). Where the ground is seasonally snow-covered, very small-scale terrain features (10^0^-10^2^) and dominant wind directions drive snow accumulation and dispersion, leading to substantial small-scale variations in maximum snow depth and the duration of seasonal snow cover - with implications for plants [@koerner21div].
