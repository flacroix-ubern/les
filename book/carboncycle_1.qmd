# Carbon cycle 1: Global pools and fluxes {#sec-carboncycle_1}

## The pre-industrial carbon cycle

Carbon is an abundant element, present in all organic matter - matter produced by biota (living organisms) - and in inorganic forms in the atmosphere, the ocean, and the lithosphere. On land, the vast majority of C is present in organic forms in living biomass - mostly of vegetation (450 PgC) and soil organic matter (1700 PgC excluding permafrost). Of the latter, a particularly large stock of C is stored in permafrost soils (1200 PgC). In the ocean, the vast majority of C mass is present in inorganic forms, dissolved in ocean water, of which 900 PgC is stored in the surface ocean (the well-mixed top few hundred meters) and 37,100 PgC is stored in the deep ocean. Dissolved organic carbon in the ocean makes up 700 PgC and 1750 PgC are stored as carbonate shells in ocean floor sediments. In the pre-industrial Earth, 591 PgC were present as CO~2~ in the atmosphere.

::: {.callout-note}
We will express all carbon fluxes and pools in units of mass C. For global-scale quantities, we use PgC:

**1 PgC = 1 petagram C = 10^15^ gC = 10^9^ tC = 1 GtC = 1 gigaton C.**

C mass is sometimes also expressed in units of mass CO~2~. The interconversion between mass C and mass CO~2~ has to consider the respective molecular masses (44.01 g mol^-1^ for CO~2~ and 12.011 g mol^-1^ for C):

**3.664 PgCO~2~ contains 1 PgC.**
:::

::: {.callout-note}
The concentration of CO~2~ in the atmosphere is measured in parts per million (ppm), expressed as a dry-air mole fraction. Therefore, ppm is an abbreviation for micromoles per mole dry air. Since the total mass of the atmosphere is well-known and CO~2~ is relatively well-mixed in the troposphere within one year, the CO~2~ concentration can directly be converted into a total atmospheric mass of C in the form of CO~2~ [@ballantyne12nat]:

**1 ppm CO~2~ = 2.124 PgC**

Under the relatively stable climate of the pre-industrial Holocene (11,700 yr BP - 1750 CE), the size of the C pools described above remained relatively stable. To simplify, we can conceive them as constant - at *steady state* - under the pre-industrial Holocene climate. This is a simplification. For example, millennial-scale trends in solar radiation inputs over the seasons and latitudes (driven by slight changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun), caused climate and vegetation changes that were substantial and in certain cases abrupt (e.g., the demise of the Green Sahara between around 6-3 ka BP @shanahan15natgeo).

Even under such a pre-industrial steady state, C fluxes between the major reservoirs or *pools* (atmosphere, ocean, land) persisted. This is indicated in @fig-carbon-pools-fluxes-ipcc by the wide orange arrows pointing up and down between the land and the atmosphere and between the ocean and the atmosphere, as well as between different pools within the ocean. In a steady state, the C flux from the atmosphere into the land roughly equals the flux from the land to the atmosphere, and the net exchange flux is zero. Hence, the pool sizes remain constant in spite of the ongoing exchange fluxes between them. We speak of a *dynamic equilibrium*.

## Carbon pool dynamics

::: {.callout-note}
## The 1st-order decay model

The concept of pools and fluxes is central for describing and modelling the carbon cycle and other biogeochemical cycles in the environment. The dynamics of a pool $C(t)$ is given by the balance of the flux of C into that pool $I(t)$ and the flux $O(t)$ leaving the pool - over time $t$. In general terms, we can write the temporal change of the pool size as

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}C(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = I(t) - O(t) \;.
$$ {#eq-inputoutput}

To simplify the expressions, we will omit $(t)$ below. But remember, that the fluxes and pools vary with time. The assumption that the out-flux $O$ scales linearly with the size of the pool $C$ is a good simplifying description (i.e., a *model*) for many processes in the environment. For example, the amount of CO~2~ produced by the decomposition (decay) of organic matter in the soil scales roughly linearly with the amount of organic matter that is being respired. This leads to the *1st-order decay model* of pool dynamics:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}C}{\mathrm{d}t} = I - kC \;.
$$ {#eq-firststorderdecay}
Here, $k$ is a decay constant and is in units of the inverse of time. In other words, it specifies the fraction of $C$ decaying per unit time (e.g,. seconds, or years). The higher $k$, the more rapidly the pool decays. For the case of $I=0$, we get $\mathrm{d}C/\mathrm{d}t = -kC$. This is a differential equation and can be understood as: What is the function that yields itself, multiplied by $-k$, when taking its derivative with respect to time? The solution is:

$$
C(t) = C_0 \; e^{-kt} \;.
$$
For example, following this model, the pool of C in soil organic matter would decay exponentially if inputs (litterfall) were zero. The decay constant $k$ determines how long it takes for it to be reduced by a certain factor. A commonly used factor is 0.5. We can calculate a *half-life* -  the time $t$ at which $C(t) = 0.5\;C_0$.

In a dynamic equilibrium the change in the pool size $C$ is by definition zero. 
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}C}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0 \;.
$$ {#eq-dynamiceq}
Combining @eq-firststorderdecay and @eq-dynamiceq and re-arranging terms leads to the steady-state pool size as a function of the in-flux and the decay constant $k$.
$$
C^\ast = I/k
$$ {#eq-steadystate}
Here, the asterisk denotes that $C$ is at steady-state. This solution indicates two aspects. First, the size of the steady-state pool is proportional to the input flux. Note that we assumed that the input flux itself has no dependency on $C$. Second, the size of the steady-state pool is inversely proportional to the decay constant. That is, the faster the decay, the smaller the steady state pool.

@eq-firststorderdecay can also be expressed in terms of an average lifetime or *turnover time* $\tau$, instead of $k$:
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}C}{\mathrm{d}t} = I - C/\tau \;.
$$ {#eq-steadystate-lifetime}

## Exercise

1. Consider the C pool of the intermediate and deep sea (37,100 PgC) in @fig-carbon-pools-fluxes-ipcc (bottom right). What is the turnover time of C in that pool?
2. Express the steady-state pool size $C^\ast$ as a function of the in-flux and the turnover time $\tau$.
3. Express the half-life constant as a function of $k$.
4. Do you know about other processes in nature that can be described by the 1st-order decay model?
:::

With the information in @fig-carbon-pools-fluxes-ipcc about pool sizes and steady-state gross fluxes (parallel input and output fluxes), and our model of pool dynamics, we get an insight about how fast C is cycling in and out of different pools. $k=I/C^\ast$ is a measure of this cycling rate. Or expressed in terms of its inverse, the turnover time $\tau$ measures how long a C atom resides in that pool. @tbl-turnover_times documents the turnover times for major pools of the global carbon cycle. The small C burial fluxes into sediments on land and on the ocean floor are the supply of what is eventually converted into the very large pool of C in carbonate rock (limestone). A small fraction of the C burial flux is in the form of organic matter, including dead plants, algae, and other microorganisms. Under high heat and pressure, a fraction of it contributes to the formation of hydrocarbons such as oil and gas - fossil fuels. The discrepancy in turnover times between the lithosphere C pool and the other pools indicates that C cycles on vastly different time scales and the slow *geological C cycle* is largely disconnected from "fast" C cycle between the atmosphere, ocean, and biosphere. Reflecting this discrepancy in time scales, the geological C cycle is not depicted in @fig-carbon-pools-fluxes-ipcc and C in fossil fuel reservoirs is treated as an *external input* to the fast C cycle.

: Pre-industrial pool sizes, input fluxes, and turnover times of major pools of the global carbon cycle. The preindustrial input flux into the atmosphere is calculated as the sum of fluxes from volcanism, total respiration and fire, freshwater, and ocean-atmosphere gas exchange from @fig-carbon-pools-fluxes-ipcc. The input flux into the surface ocean is the sum of ocean-atmosphere gas exchange and the flux from intermediate and deep sea. The flux from marine biota is not additional to the ocean-atmosphere exchange flux. The pool size of the biosphere is taken as the sum of vegetation and soils. The permafrost C pool is relatively inert. The size of the lithosphere C pool includes C in the form of sedimentary (carbonate) rocks and kerogens (solid, insoluble organic matter in sedimentary rocks). Its estimate is based on @falkowski00sci. The input flux into the lithosphere is calculated as the sum of burial on land, rock weathering, and ocean floor sedimentation {#tbl-turnover_times}

It should be noted that the turnover time $\tau$ describes the average time that an atom of C resides in the respective pool. This is a simplification. In the C pool 'terrestrial biosphere', not every C atom has the same probability of being oxidized and respired as CO~2~. Hence, in reality, $\tau$ is a wide distribution, ranging from seconds to years for non-structural carbon derived from photosynthesis, decades to centuries for C in woody biomass, and to millennia for a small fraction of soil organic matter, especially if the C is protected from oxidation, for example in water-logged soils. The turnover time should therefore be understood as a diagnostic, useful for describing the average systems dynamics in a simplified way, and subsuming multiple processes that operate at different time scales, contributing to different portions of C conversion to CO~2~.

The range of turnover times (e.g., within the terrestrial biosphere) arise because C is transferred between multiple pools within the biosphere and the ocean. Going to the next more detailed level of abstraction (model representation), multiple C pools in terrestrial ecosystems can be distinguished (e.g., non-structural C, leaves, roots, wood, litter, soil organic matter, microbes). Some C "cascades" through multiple pools, some is quickly respired back into the atmosphere. The interpretation that $k$ equals the inverse of the turnover time $\tau$, and that the turnover time equals the mean age of all C atoms in that pool, and that the mean *transit time* (the time it takes between an atom of C entering a pool until it exits that pool again) equals $\tau$ is only valid for certain cases, and not for "C cascades" with fluxes between multiple pools. Requirements are that we're dealing with a single pool, that this pool is at steady-state, that it has been so for an infinitely long time, that $I$ and $k$ are constant over time, and the flux leaving the pool is a linear function of the pool size ($O=kC$) [@sierra17gcb]. The transit time is the same as *residence time* - a term used more commonly in hydrology. 


## The anthropogenic perturbation

Although fossil fuels are formed by natural processes of the C cycle, their combustion can be regarded as an external input of C into the (modern) global C cycle. This is because the time scale at which the reservoir of fossil fuels is depleted (10^2^ yr) stands in stark contrast to the time scale at which it was formed (10^8^ yr, see turnover time of C in the lithosphere in @tbl-turnover_times). The C is added in the form of CO~2~ to the atmosphere from where it is taken up by the ocean through diffusion and equilibration of the ocean surface water's CO~2~ partial pressure with the atmosphere's CO~2~ partial pressure, and by the terrestrial biosphere through photosynthesis. It is important to note that CO~2~ in the atmosphere does not decay through physical or chemical processes, nor are there C sinks on land or in the ocean that remove C away from the "fast" C cycle - except the burial into sediments (see @fig-carbon-pools-fluxes-ipcc and @tbl-turnover_times). However the magnitude of the burial fluxes are dwarfed by the magnitude of C inputs through the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. Hence, the fossil fuel combustion leads to an accumulation of the total amount of C cycling in the "fast" C cycle and the added C gets *redistributed* between the spheres. The net fluxes from the atmosphere into land ecosystems and the ocean arise because the total terrestrial and oceanic C pools are increasing as CO~2~ is emitted into the atmosphere and the atmospheric CO~2~ concentration is rising. In subsequent chapters (@sec-carboncycle_2 and @sec-carboncycle_3), we will learn about the processes driving the CO~2~ uptake by land and ocean and the dynamics of the C redistribution in the Earth system. In this chapter, we will look at the *global C budget* - how much C has been emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation and how much of this C has accumulated in the atmosphere and how much has been taken up by the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere?

The global C budget can be defined for globally aggregated fluxes as the balance between emissions from fossil fuels $E_\mathrm{FF}$ and land use change $E_\mathrm{LUC}$ on the left side of the equation and the redistribution of C among the atmosphere, land and ocean. $G_\mathrm{atm}$ is the atmospheric growth rate, $S_\mathrm{ocean}$ is the net ocean C uptake (also referred to as the *ocean sink*) and $S_\mathrm{land}$ is the net land C uptake (or *land sink*). A net flux from the atmosphere into the ocean or into land C storage is positive.

$$
E_\mathrm{FF} + E_\mathrm{LUC} = G_\mathrm{atm} + S_\mathrm{ocean} + S_\mathrm{land}
$$ {#eq-carbon_budget}

This terminology is adopted from the [Global Carbon Budget](https://globalcarbonbudget.org/) [@friedlingstein23essd] and is expressed as global annual total fluxes. The separation of $E_\mathrm{LUC}$ and $S_\mathrm{land}$ is not straight-forward, but can be understood in a simplified fashion as spatially separated fluxes, whereby the land sink occurs only on areas that are not affected by land use change (LUC). In reality, LUC affects the land sink which complicates a separation of the two components. This is further resolved in @sec-landusechange.

The values of the global carbon budget components are given in @fig-carbon-pools-fluxes-ipcc for an average across years 2010-2019, where $S_\mathrm{ocean}$ corresponds to the 'net ocean flux' and $S_\mathrm{land}$ corresponds to the the 'net land flux'. $E_\mathrm{LUC}$ corresponds to 'net land-use change'. The 'net' indicates that $E_\mathrm{LUC}$ is the net effect between CO~2~ emissions from deforestation and C uptake by re-growing forests and afforestations. Note that the annual atmospheric growth rate is not resolved in @fig-carbon-pools-fluxes-ipcc. The most recent update of the global carbon budget from @friedlingstein23essd is given in @tbl-gcb2023 as 10-year averages of annual fluxes for years 2013-2022 and cumulative fluxes for the industrial era - years 1750-2022.

: Global carbon budget (in PgC and PgC yr^-1^) from the 2023 update by @friedlingstein23essd {#tbl-gcb2023}

Estimates of each global carbon budget compenent are largely independent from each other and rely on different types of observations, data, and methods. $E_\mathrm{FF}$ estimates are based on energy statistics and cement production data. Values reported by @friedlingstein23essd include the cement carbonation sink. Without that sink, the value of $E_\mathrm{FF}$ for 2022 would be about 0.2 PgC yr^-1^ higher. $E_\mathrm{LUC}$ estimates are based on land-use and land-use change data from national statistics and forest carbon "bookkeeping models". These models use information about vegetation C stocks, forest C re-growth curves, and the fate of C after deforestation and harvesting (e.g., wood products lifetime). Atmospheric CO~2~ concentration, and hence the accumulation of C in the atmosphere, is measured directly and bears the least uncertainty among all carbon budget components. The ocean sink is estimated from global ocean CO~2~ uptake models and observation-based products. In @friedlingstein23essd, the land sink is estimated from dynamic global vegetation models.

Advances in observations and modelling in recent years now enable the land and ocean sink to be estimated in a "bottom-up fashion" - using models of land and ocean C uptake. Since every component of the global carbon budget is thereby estimated independently, a *budget imbalance* term $B_\mathrm{IM}$ can be defined. A value of zero indicates that models of the land and ocean C uptake exactly match the (better known) emission terms minus the atmospheric growth rate.
$$
B_\mathrm{IM} = E_\mathrm{FF} + E_\mathrm{LUC} - (G_\mathrm{atm} + S_\mathrm{ocean} + S_\mathrm{land})
$$ {#eq-budget_imbalance}
 
Today, the global carbon budget is well specified thanks to reliable estimates of its individual components. The budget imbalance is only a small fraction of the total emissions. Until recently, "bottom-up" estimates of $S_\mathrm{land}$ by land C cycle models were deemed insufficient for providing reliable estimates. Instead, $S_\mathrm{land}$ was estimated as the budget residual by neglecting $B_\mathrm{IM}$ and rearranging terms in @eq-budget_imbalance to solve for $S_\mathrm{land}$. In fact, when the IPCC First Assessment Report was published in 1990, the existence of C sink on land was not known and it was treated as a budget imbalance and referred to as the 'missing sink'. It is stated that "there are possible processes on land which could account for the missing CO~2~ (but it has not been possible to verify them)".

It was only later that the existence of a terrestrial C sink could be more firmly established and quantified thanks to parallel measurements of the atmospheric O~2~ and CO~2~ concentrations [@keeling96nat]. (In fact, the ratio O~2~/N~2~ is measured to avoid the much larger measurement uncertainty in absolute O~2~ measurements). The ratios of O~2~:CO~2~ are known from the stoichiometric molecular formulae for photosynthesis (O~2~:CO~2~ = 1.1), fossil fuel combustion (O~2~:CO~2~ = 1.4) and ocean uptake (O~2~:CO~2~ = 0). An ocean O~2~ source from marine organisms has to be factored in. Given the total C emissions from fossil fuel combustion, the net land C balance can thus be calculated and the calculation visualized geometrically (@fig-o2_n2_co2). Note that net emissions from land use change are not considered and the "land sink" in @fig-o2_n2_co2 is the net of $E_\mathrm{LUC}$ and $S_\mathrm{land}$ in @eq-carbon_budget.

We can adopt the perspective of C cycle science stated in earlier publications. @falkowski00sci wrote: "*Direct determination of changes in terrestrial carbon storage has proven extremely difficult. Rather, the contribution of terrestrial ecosystems to carbon storage is inferred from changes in the concentrations of atmospheric gases, especially CO~2~ and O~2~ [...].*" In that sense, let's consider the land sink to be the budget residual and assume that the ocean sink estimate is accurate (indeed, its uncertainty is only about half the uncertainty in bottom-up land sink estimates, @tbl-gcb2023). Visually contrasting emissions and their redistribution reveals an interesting pattern (@fig-carbon_budget). The substantial year-to-year (interannual) variations in the land sink are almost exclusively responsible for interannual variations in the atmospheric growth rate. Total emissions and the ocean sink exhibit little interannual variation. By definition, the sum of the atmospheric growth rate, land and ocean sink is equal to the sum of emissions from fossil fuels and land use change.
