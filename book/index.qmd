# About this book {.unnumbered}

This online navigatable book serves as the material for the course with the same name - Land in the Earth System. It is written by Prof. [Benjamin Stocker](https://geco-group.org/author/benjamin-stocker/), Institute of Geography, University of Bern.

This book introduces processes of the terrestrial biosphere and how they drive Earth system dynamics. The course starts with identifying general patterns in vegetation, carbon, and water fluxes and stocks, and connects them with underlying principles, governing controls, and quantitative frameworks for their description and prediction. A special focus will be put on introducing the role of terrestrial biosphere in driving and being driven by climate change and global environmental change.

The book covers a diverse thematic ground - as diverse as the processes of the biosphere. Topics range from biogeography, the global carbon cycle, land-climate interactions, ecohydrology, to Earth system dynamics.

## Learning objectives

- Identify the controls on water and carbon fluxes across the Earth.
- Explain what drives the diverse vegetation types across the Earthâ€™s biomes.
- Distinguish different aspects of drought trends.
- Understand the role of biogeochemical cycles and their feedbacks, amplifying (or moderating) climate change.

## Target audience and prerequisites

BSc Geography major and minors at the University of Bern.
