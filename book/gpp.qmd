# Gross primary production and photosynthesis {#sec-gpp}

In @sec-globalcarbonbudget, we conceived the global carbon cycle as a system of three pools (atmosphere, land, ocean), emissions as fluxes into the system (added to the atmosphere), and fluxes between the pools. The C dynamics in the land biosphere were modeled using a 1-box model which receives C inputs through photosynthesis and loses C through a constant turnover. In this chapter, we dive deeper into the processes that drive photosynthetic carbon uptake by land ecosystems.

## Light use efficiency model

@monteith72 made the observation that the biomass productivity of a given (well-watered) crop (in the tropics) scales linearly with the amount of absorbed solar radiation, integrated over weeks to months. This observation underlies the general light use efficiency (LUE) model which describes ecosystem-level apparent photosynthesis (referred to as *gross primary production*, GPP) as the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and the efficiency at which photons are used for assimilating C (LUE). 
$$
\mathrm{GPP} = \mathrm{PPFD} \cdot \mathrm{fAPAR} \cdot \mathrm{LUE}
$$ {#eq-luemodel}
GPP is expressed as a C flux per unit ground area and per unit time (e.g., gC m^-2^ s^-1^). PPFD measures the solar radiation flux, incident at the top of the canopy. It is expressed, e.g., in units of mol (photons) m^-2^ s^-1^. The light use efficiency model (@eq-luemodel) is also often formulated using the photosynthetically active (solar) radiation (PAR) in units of an energy flux per unit ground area (e.g., J m^-2^), instead of PPFD. This is equivalent to the expression with respect to PPFD, considering that each photon (light quantum) bears a certain amount of radiation energy (see, e.g., [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_energy)). fAPAR is the fraction (unitless) of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. It depends on the total ecosystem-level (or canopy-level) surface area of green leaves (@sec-light-absorption). LUE is the light use efficiency, measuring the efficiency with which photons are harvested and used for assimilating CO~2~ by the photosynthetic machinery (@sec-photosynthesis). It is expressed, e.g., in units of gC (mol CO~2~)^-1^.

Of course, a relationship with biomass productivity, as observed by @monteith72 should not be equated with a relationship with GPP. However, again, over longer periods of time, a given plant converts assimilated carbon into biomass at a relatively constant rate (see @sec-carboncycle_ecosystem). Therefore, the observation by @monteith72 is instructive for our understanding. Indeed, models of terrestrial GPP are often formulated in the form of @eq-luemodel and are useful for estimating how GPP values over space and time (at the scale of weeks to months). The aspect that the observations by @monteith72 were made under well-watered conditions is a further caveat. However, it shall serve us in this chapter as we are - for now - ignoring the effects by limited root-zone water availability. We will relieve this simplification in @sec-landclimate and @sec-ecohydrology.

The linear dependence of GPP on PPFD implies that the variations of solar radiation over the seasons and across latitude directly translate to how GPP varies across these scales. This will be further described in @sec-global-patterns. Note that at shorter time scales, GPP is no longer linearly related to PAR. Through its influence on GPP, as described by @eq-luemodel, solar radiation is the "engine" of photosynthetic CO~2~ uptake by the terrestrial ecosystems. Temporal and spatial patterns of GPP are strongly driven by patterns in solar radiation. The astronomical mechanics responsible for temporal and spatial (latitudinal) patterns in solar radiation will be introduced in @sec-global-patterns. For now, let's remember that the incoming (incident) solar radiation is an energy flux that varies strongly over the course of a day and a year. These diurnal and seasonal patterns are different along different latitudes (position north or south of the Equator). In the following, we delve deeper into the two factors fAPAR and LUE in @eq-luemodel.


## Canopy light absorption {#sec-light-absorption}

Photosynthetic CO~2~ uptake only operates if active (green) leaves are out. The relationship between the amount of leaves and GPP are introduced here. Active leaf area varies across the seasons and space in response to the seasonality of temperature and light and water availability. The seasonal fluctuation of leaf area, most visible for deciduous trees, is referred to as (leaf) phenology. The drivers of temporal and spatial variations of phenology and leaf area are introduced later.

The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) increases with the projected (one-sided) surface area of leaves per unit ground area (the *leaf area index*, LAI). Note that the total surface area of leaves is roughly twice the projected surface area. The LAI is an ecosystem-level variable and reflects the leaf area density of the whole canopy which may be composed of multiple species and organised in multiple canopy layers (@fig-light_absorption). While temperate and boreal forests may form a single understorey and attain LAI values of 4-6 m^2^ m^-1^, tropical moist forests may have multiple canopy layers and an LAI of over 6 m^2^ m^-1^ (@fig-lai).

```

While the intensity of shortwave (solar) radiation is highest at the top of the canopy, it is progressively attenuated as it penetrates into the canopy. Radiation gets reflected, absorbed and transmitted by individual leaves. Each of these processes affects light differently in different wavelengths, depends on the solar zenith angle, on the three-dimensional arrangement of leaves in the canopy (angles, "clumping"), and on the pigments on the leaf surfaces that are responsible for light absorption. Pigments change across species and may vary in response to stress (e.g., by frost, heat, or water limitation). 

In brief, canopy *radiative transfer* is complex. A simple model of radiation extinction is given by the *Beer-Lambert law*. To apply it for radiative transfer in the canopy, we assume that a leaf only *absorbs* light, but does not reflect or transmit it. Following this model, the light extinction at canopy depth $z$ (measuring from the top) is proportional to the light intensity at that depth and an "optical density" $\mu$.
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}I}{\mathrm{d}z} = -\mu\;I(z)
$$
We further assume that the canopy is a homogenous turbid medium. In other words, we assume that leaves are uniformly distributed across the canopy and that the optical density is given by the leaf area index $L$ divided by the total canopy depth $z_0$:
$$
\mu = k \frac{L}{z_0}
$$
$k$ is the leaf area-specific optical density, or *light extinction coefficient*. Therefore, the radiation intensity at the bottom of the canopy ($z_0$) is:
$$
I(z_0) = I_0 \; e^{-kL}\;,
$$
and the fraction of absorbed (photosynthetically active) radiation is
$$
\mathrm{fAPAR} = 1 - e^{-kL}\;.
$$
A typical value of the light extinction coefficient $k$ in the visible (photosynthetically active) wavelength spectrum is 0.5. 

The radiation $I$ consists of *direct* radiation from the sun and *diffuse* radiation from the sky and from radiation scattered within the canopy. This distinction is relevant for understanding radiation absorption by the canopy and canopy-level photosynthesis. Two important implications are the following. First, diffuse radiation is more effectively absorbed by canopies, particularly at low LAI. The reduction of GPP under cloudy conditions is therefore less than what would be expected from considering only changes in $I_0$ (the effective $k$ is higher for diffuse radiation than for direct radiation). 

Second, the energy flux of direct radiation is much higher than that of diffuse radiation. Although at greater canopy depths, leaves are more frequently exposed to diffuse than to direct radiation, the latter provides potentially valuable energy for photosynthesis, but occurs very rarely (*sunflecks*). Leaves have to balance the rare high-intensity light levels and the frequent low-intensity levels for adjusting photosynthetic capacities.

## Photosynthesis {#sec-photosynthesis}

The efficiency at which absorbed photons (radiation) are converted into C in the form of sugars depends on the conductance to CO~2~ uptake by the leaf and on the activity of the photosynthetic machinery. In this subsection, we dive very deep into the term LUE in @eq-luemodel.

CO~2~ uptake by the leaf happens by diffusion through pores at the leaf surface (*stomata*, @fig-stomata). The opening of stomata is dynamically regulated in response to environmental conditions (light, CO~2~, temperature, atmospheric humidity) and controls the conductance to CO~2~ diffusion. The CO~2~ uptake flux by diffusive transport through stomata can thus be described by *Fick's law* which states that the flux is proportional to the concentration difference of CO~2~ inside and outside the leaf.
$$
A = g_s(c_a - c_i)
$$ {#eq-photo-fick}
$c_a$ is the ambient CO~2~ concentration (outside the leaf), and $c_i$ is the CO~2~ concentration at the chloroplast. $g_s$ is the stomatal conductance. Note that we use the variable name $A$ here for CO~2~ assimilation by photosynthesis. In constrast to the ecosystem-level variable GPP, $A$ refers to the leaf-level flux.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-stomata
#| fig-cap: "CO~2~ diffuses into the leaf through stomata, while water vapour diffuses out of the leaf. The water vapour diffusion out of the leaves (transpiration) is introduced in @sec-landclimate."
#| out-width: 80%
knitr::include_graphics("images/stomata.png")
```

Photosynthetic CO~2~ assimilation leads to a continous depletion of CO~2~ inside the leaf. Therefore, $c_i$ reflects photosynthetic rates. This description of $A$ is specific for plants that follow the C~3~ photosynthetic pathway - the majority of plants and all trees. Grasses growing in warm climates predominantly follow the C~4~ photosynthetic pathway (see @sec-c4). 

Modelling photosynthesis is relatively complex because $g_s$ depends on $A$. @eq-photo-fick can therefore not be solved in a straight-forward manner. Furthermore, plants coordinate stomatal conductance to balance water losses and C assimilation but the exact relationship varies between species and depends on a multitude of mechanisms and traits related water transport in the plant (@sec-transpiration). Here, let's start by taking $g_s$ as given and look at how the assimilation rate $A$ depends on $c_i$.

The primary processes are happening in the chloroplasts which are located in the mesophyll cells of leaves. After diffusing across stomata, CO~2~ diffuses across the mesophyll cell to the chloroplast. The conductance to this diffusion step - mesophyll conductance - is often ignored for modelling photosynthesis. Reflecting this, we are referring to "leaf-internal CO~2~ concentration, $c_i$" here, instead of a more correct CO~2~ concentration at the chloroplast.

Before returning to a mathematical description of photosynthesis, let's step back and look at the process of leaf-level photosyntheis. Three steps of the photosynthetic apparatus can be distinguished (based on @lambers08 and @bonan).

### Light absorption at the cellular level

Light (photons) in the photosynthetically active wavelength spectrum (400-700 nm) is absorbed by *pigments* - mainly chlorophyll. The absorbed energy is transported in the form of excited chlorophyll to the reaction centers of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII). Relevant for photosynthesis is the number of photons in the photosynthetically active spectrum, not their total energy. That's why @eq-luemodel is expressed in units of photons, not energy (Watts). A photon in the blue wavelength has the same effect on CO~2~ assimilation as a photon in the red wavelength. The excess energy is dissipated as heat or through other pathways.

### Light reactions

In the reaction centers, the excitation energy is used for splitting electrons from water molecules, producing oxygen (O~2~) as a "side-product". The electrons are transported along the electron transport chain and are used to produce NADPH and ATP. These are called the *light reactions* of photosynthesis. Up to here, radiation energy has been converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP. The production of ATP consumes inorganic phosphate.

### Calvin cycle {#sec-calvin-cycle}

NADPH and ATP are then used for reducing CO~2~ (the energy-demanding reversal of oxidation) in the *Calvin cycle*. This step forms C~3~ compounds (triose-phosphates) and occurs independently of light. It is therefore commonly referred to as the "dark reactions" of photosynthesis. Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is the principal enzyme involved in the Calvin cycle and the amount of Rubisco determines the capacity for the carboxylation of RuBP (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate). Rubisco also catalyzes the oxygenation of RuBP which consumes O~2~ and produces CO~2~ as part of *photorespiration*. This respiration scales with photosynthetic activity and reduces the net photosynthetic CO~2~ by 30-50%, depending on the relative concentrations of CO~2~ and O~2~. At very low CO~2~ levels, around 30-50 ppm, the *photorespiratory compensation point* is reached and net photosynthesis is zero. In contrast to photorespiration, *dark respiration* ($R_d$), which also produces CO~2~, arises from the decarboxylation of Rubisco and is independent of light, but proportional to the amount of Rubisco.

Reduced C in the form of sucrose or (after an additional step) starch is either consumed in the leaf during the night, or exported through the phloem and used for synthesising biomass or supplying plant-internal C storage as *non-structural C*.

### Summary

The chemical summary equation of photosynthesis is:
$$
n\mathrm{CO}_2 + 2n\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \rightarrow (\mathrm{CH}_2\mathrm{O})_n + n\mathrm{O}_2 + n\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}
$$ {#eq-photosynthesis-chemical}
A total of eight photons is consumed to assimilate one molecule of CO~2~. For each molecule of CO~2~, one molecule of O~2~ is produced. And for each molecule of CO~2~, one molecule of H~2~O is consumed (net). Note however, that this water consumption is not the primary reason for why plants use water. A much larger amount of water is consumed by the diffusion of water vapour from the water-saturated air inside the leaves out of the stomata. This *transpiration* flux is further explained in @sec-landclimate.

### Response to light and CO~2~ {#sec-fvcb}

The three steps described above operate in series and each step is potentially rate-limiting and responds differently to the environment. The rates are coordinated such that they are roughly co-limiting for average environmental conditions to which a leaf is exposed during a day. An imbalance of rates can lead to an excess production of electrons and can cause damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. This happens for example when leaves are exposed to very cold temperatures and high light during a frost event, or when you move your indoor plant that has been sitting in a dark corner for years suddenly into full sunlight outdoors.

The response of photosynthetic CO~2~ assimilation ($A$) to light (PPFD) and leaf-internal CO~2~ ($c_i$) reflects the serial nature of how the light and dark reactions are connected. $A$ saturates both in response to increasing PPFD as well as to increasing $c_i$. When a leaf is exposed to increasing PPFD, $A$ initially increases and eventually saturates (@fig-photosynthesis_light). The slope of the initial linear increase reflects the efficiency at which photons are used for CO~2~ assimilation (the *quantum yield* $\varphi_0$). Under these conditions, light, i.e. the rate of the light reactions, are limiting, not CO~2~. Under conditions of very high light, the dark reactions of the Calvin cycle become limiting. The assimilation rate attained under saturating light is commonly referred to as $A_\mathrm{sat}$.

The level at which the light response of $A$ saturates varies within a species and across different species. Variations within species arise through the *acclimation* of the light reaction capacities to the typical light intensities to which a leaf is exposed. Acclimation evolves over time scales of weeks to months (Thus, your indoor plant suffers because the change to high-light conditions happened to fast.). $A_\mathrm{sat}$ also varies across species, reflecting the *adaptation* through evolution of different species to the environment in which they commonly grow. Typical difference in light adaptation are evident between plants that grow in the shady understorey versus plants that grow in the sun-exposed upper canopy.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/assim_response_to_light_lambers08.png")
```

In a similar fashion, the response of $A$ to $c_i$ initially increase and saturates at high $c_i$. This is reflected by the so-called "*A*-*c*~i~ curve". Commonly, net assimilation $A_n=A-R_d$ is considered. $A_n$ is initially negative until the photorespiratory compensation point ($\Gamma^\ast$) is reached. Then, $A_n$ increases steeply with $c_i$ as it is limited by the rate of RuBP carboxylation by Rubisco ($V_\mathrm{cmax}$). This functional response of assimilation is commonly denoted $A_C$. As $c_i$ increases further, $A$ is no longer limited by RuBP carboxylation, but by the rate at which RuBP becomes available. This, in turn, is governed by the rate at which ATP and NADPH are produced and thus by the rate of electron transport $J$. This functional response of assimilation is commonly denoted $A_J$. A limiting electron transport rate may be due to limiting light or a limiting capacity of electron transport ($J_\mathrm{max}$). A slower further increase of $A$ with $c_i$ in the electron transport-limited range is due to the suppression of RuBP oxygenation at high concentrations of CO~2~ (relative to O~2~). The effective assimilation rate across the full range of $c_i$ is the minimum of the electron transport-limited and the RuBP carboxylation-limited rate:
$$
A_n = \min(A_C, A_J) - R_d
$$

The *A*-*c*~i~ curve (@fig-a-ci-curve) can be measured in the field and reveals multiple quantities ($V_\mathrm{cmax}$, $J_\mathrm{max}$, $\Gamma^\ast$, and the "shape parameters" of $A_C$ and $A_J$). These quantities are key for quantitatively describing and modeling leaf photosynthesis. The acclimation and adaptation of $A_\mathrm{max}$ (@fig-photosynthesis_light) reflects an acclimation and adaptation of the electron transport capacity and the capacity for RuBP carboxylation. Although acclimation can occur, it is not fast enough to respond to the strongly varying light conditions during a day. Therefore, plants have to tune the capacities of the different photosynthetic reactions such that they are mostly near the co-limitation point.

### Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry model

Following the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry (FvCB) model for C~3~ photosynthesis [@farquhar80], the RuBP carboxylation-limited assimilation rate $A_C$ can be described as
$$
A_C = V_\mathrm{cmax} \frac{c_i - \Gamma^\ast}{c_i + K} \;,
$$ {#eq-ac}
where $K$ is the effective Michaelis-Menten coefficient for $A_C$, considering the balance of carboxylation and oxygenation by Rubisco. It depends on the partial pressure of oxygen ($p\mathrm{O}_2$).
$$
K = K_c \left(1 + \frac{p\mathrm{O}_2}{K_o} \right)
$$
$V_\mathrm{cmax}$, $K_c$, $K_o$, and $\Gamma^\ast$ all have a temperature dependency. In addition, $\Gamma^\ast$ is proportional to atmospheric pressure. These dependencies are shown in @sec-ftemp and are described in full detail in @stocker20gmd. 

The electron transport-limited assimilation rate $A_J$ can be described as
$$
A_J = \frac{J}{4} \cdot \frac{c_i - \Gamma^\ast}{c_i + 2 \Gamma^\ast}\;.
$$ {#eq-aj}
The electron transport rate $J$ is described by a saturating function that increases with absorbed light $I_\mathrm{abs}$ up to a maximum rate $J_\mathrm{max}$
$$
J = \frac{4\varphi_0 I_\mathrm{abs}}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{4\varphi_0 I_\mathrm{abs}}{J_\mathrm{max}}\right)^2}}
$$ {#eq-jmaxlim}

Together, @eq-ac and @eq-aj describe the combined effect of $c_i$, (leaf) temperature, the absorbed photon flux density, and atmospheric pressure on leaf-level CO~2~ assimilation. *A-c*~i~ and the *A* vs. PPFD curves, as shown for measurements in @fig-photosynthesis_light and @fig-a-ci-curve, can thereby be modeled.

@fig-a-ppfd-curve-rpmodel shows the light response curve of $A_J - R_d$ following the FvCB model. The response is shown for leaves acclimated to different levels of light, thus having different values for $J_\mathrm{max}$. Because acclimation to light also involves a change in the Rubisco content of leaves and thus $V_\mathrm{cmax}$, "high-light leaves" also have higher dark respiration rates. Therefore, under low light conditions, leaves acclimated to low light have higher net assimilation rates than leaves acclimated to high light. This is illustrated by @fig-a-ppfd-curve-rpmodel **a**.

Note that the FvCB model, on its own, does not allow us to model the LUE term in @eq-luemodel. An important additional ingredient is the stomatal conductance ($g_s$) which is relevant for determining the ratio of ambient to leaf-internal CO~2~ concentrations. It is described in @sec-transpiration.

### Response to temperature {#sec-ftemp}

The instantaneous temperature dependency of leaf-level photosynthesis reflects the combined effect of the temperature dependencies in $V_\mathrm{cmax}$, $J_\mathrm{max}$, $K_c$, $K_o$, and $\Gamma^\ast$, and is shown in @fig-temp_dep. For this, $c_i$, $V_\mathrm{cmax}$, $J_\mathrm{max}$, $K_c$, $K_o$, and $\Gamma^\ast$ at a reference temperature are assumed to be given.

As shown in @fig-temp_dep, the instantaneous response of assimilation rates to temperature has a peak above which rates, especially $A_C$, decline sharply. Dark respiration ($R_d$) monotonically increases with temperature which accentuates the decline in net assimilation $A_n$ with increasing temperature.

The temperature dependencies shown in @fig-temp_dep are referred to as *instantaneous* because $c_i$, $V_\mathrm{cmax}$, and $J_\mathrm{max}$ acclimate to the environment on time scales of days to weeks and $g_s$ is regulated on time scales of seconds to minutes. This acclimation affects the temperature response. Therefore, the functional relationships shown here are relevant for understanding how CO~2~ uptake varies in response to temperature over the course of a day. However, over longer time scales, plants acclimate to their growth environment such that the temperature optimum of photosynthesis (the peak of the $A_n$-temperature curve) shifts as a function of the *growth temperature* - an average temperature to which the leaf is exposed @fig-topt-kumarathunge.

### C~4~ photosynthesis {#sec-c4}

Coming soon.
    
## Transpiration and leaf water-carbon coupling {#sec-transpiration}

The opening of stomata is highly sensitive to environmental factors and the CO~2~ assimilation rate feeds back to stomatal opening. By opening and closing stomata, plants regulate the conductance to CO~2~ diffusion from the ambient air into the leaves and to the photosynthesis reaction sites. Simultaneously, when stomata are open, water vapour diffuses out of the leaf - *transpiration*. This link between CO~2~ and water loss is at the core of stomatal regulation to balance C uptake and desiccation.

The diffusive supply of CO~2~ to the photosynthetic reaction sites is determined by a series of conductances. The description of the diffusive CO~2~ uptake in @eq-photo-fick resolves this as a single conductance. However, stomatal conductance is only one chain in this series. More realistically, the leaf boundary layer conductance and the mesophyll conductance are treated separately from the stomatal conductance. However, because the leaf boundary layer conductance is much larger than the stomatal conductance, it is not limiting. Furthermore, actively regulated plant physiological responses to the environment arise through the stomatal conductance $g_s$. As described in @sec-photosynthesis, mesophyll conductance is often ignored due to practical limitations for separating it from stomatal conductance in measurements and due to very poorly known dependencies to the environment. Hence, we focus on $g_s$ here and describe the diffusive CO~2~ supply to photosynthesis by @eq-photo-fick.

The diffusive water vapour flux out of the leaf - transpiration - is driven by the difference of water vapour pressure in the leaf-interior air spaces ($e_i$) and the the water vapour pressure at the leaf surface ($e_s$). Their difference is commonly referred to as the *vapour pressure deficit* (VPD), here denoted as $D = e_s - e_i$. Leaf-interior air spaces are water vapour-saturated, while the surrounding air is not. Fick's law predicts that a diffusive flux occurs in presence of a concentration difference, hence transpiration can be described as
$$
E = 1.6 \; g_s \; D
$$ {#eq-transpiration}
The factor 1.6 arises due to the lower diffusivity of CO~2~ compared with H~2~O. Hence, $g_s$ has to be understood as a conductance to CO~2~ diffusion (mol CO~2~ m^-2^ s^-1^). Note that $g_s$ regulates both transpiration (@eq-transpiration) and assimilation (@eq-photo-fick) at the leaf-level. A tight coupling between water and carbon fluxes at the leaf-level follows from the physical principle of diffusion.

Water loss through transpiration poses risks and incurs costs for a plant. The diffusive water vapour flux through stomata has to be maintained by root water uptake from the soil and transport along the xylem in the plant. When the water content in the rooting zone declines, it becomes increasingly hard for plants to extract water from the soil - they have to "suck" out the water with a increasingly negative water potential - a negative pressure. The hydraulic relationships of water transport along the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum will be introduced later. What matters here is that such negative water potentials along the water transport pathway are dangerous for the plant and can lead to lethal desiccation of cells, leaves, branches, or entire plants. 

Avoidance of dangerous desiccation is enabled by responses at the level of leaves and the plant which operate at a range of time scales. At time scales of seconds to minutes and at the level of a leaf, stomatal conductance is reduced in response to dry air and dry soil conditions. At time scales of weeks to months, or even years, the the leaf area of a plant may decline under dry conditions. At even longer time scales (albeit this time scale is subject to large unknowns and active research), plants are genetically adapted (or may acclimate within their lifetime) to dry conditions by resistant water transport (resistant xylem) and effective water uptake organs (deeper roots). 

Obviously, such adaptations and the largely instantaneous stomatal response incurs a cost - the opportunity cost of reduced CO~2~ assimilation when stomatal conductance is reduced and the construction cost of building water-stress adapted organs. Hence, plants always have to balance carbon uptake and water loss and a tight *carbon-water coupling* at the level of plants, and ecosystems arises from these leaf-level processes.

### Water use efficiency

The trade-off between transpiration and assimilation can be measured by considering their ratio by combining @eq-photo-fick and @eq-transpiration to define the *instantaneous water-use efficiency*:
$$
\frac{A_n}{E} = \frac{c_a(1 - \chi)}{1.6\;D}\;,
$$ {#eq-wue-instantaneous}
where $\chi = c_i/c_a$. The instantaneous water-use efficiency is proportional to $D^{-1}$. In other words, the drier the air, the more transpiration per unit net CO~2~ assimilation a leaf "suffers". This demonstrates the strong effect of atmospheric dryness on the water-carbon trade-off. To remove the effect of vapour pressure deficit ($D$) on transpiration and focus on the biological component of the water-carbon trade-off, the *intrinsic water-use efficiency* (iWUE) is defined by relating net assimilation to stomatal conductance: 
$$
\frac{A_n}{g_s} = \frac{c_a}{1.6}(1 - \chi)
$$ {#eq-wue-intrinsic}
Note that @eq-wue-instantaneous and @eq-wue-intrinsic are written as being proportional to $c_a(1-\chi)$. Of course, this term is mathematically equivalent to $(c_a - c_i)$. However, there is a reason for expressing it this way. First, it reflects the direct influence of $c_a$ ambient (atmospheric) CO~2~ concentration on the water-carbon trade-off - less water is lost for a given amount of C assimilation under elevated CO~2~. Second, observations suggest that $\chi$ is regulated by plants to remain relatively constant under a wide range of CO~2~ levels [@ainsworth05] and @fig-constant-chi. The near constancy of $\chi$ is also reflected by the observation that $A_n$ and $g_s$ vary in near proportion across a wide range of light levels [@bonan].

### Isotopic fractionation {#sec-carbon-isotopes}

Coming soon.

### Stomatal regulation

Stomatal openings - and therefore the effective leaf stomatal conductance - are regulated by plant-internal signalling mechanisms that respond to the water-carbon trade-off within minutes. Two important relations underlie this trade-off. First, transpiration directly depends on the vapor pressure deficit ($D$) expressed through the diffusion equation @eq-transpiration. Second, while the assimilation rate ($A$) depends on stomatal conductance ($g_s$), $A$ also feeds back on $g_s$. This relationship is has an empirical basis as shown in @fig-constant-chi a. From this, a relationship of $g_s$ as a function of $D$ and $A$ can be established. However, due to the feedback between $A$ and $g_s$, deriving an analytical solution is not straight-forward.

An empirical solution that reflects the dependency of $g_s$ on $D$ and on $A$ - as represented by a saturating function to light - is presented by @oren01 for diurnal variations at the canopy-level as:
$$
G_s = \frac{I_0}{I_0 + a} \left( b + m \ln D \right)
$$
The uppercase $G_s$ denotes stomatal conductance at the canopy-level - in contrast to $g_s$ described above at the leaf-level. The first term represents an empirical representation of the light ($I_0$)-dependency of photosynthesis. $a$, $b$, and $m$ are empirically fitted coefficients.

There is empirical evidence that *optimality models* are a good representation of how stomata are regulated. Following this notion, it can be assumed that stomatal conductance is optimised such that the net between the carbon gain by increasing stomatal conductance and the carbon cost by the resulting increased transpiration and is maximized. 

$$
A - aE - bV_\mathrm{cmax} = \arg \max
$$ {#eq-optim-max}

Over time scales of days to weeks, $V_\mathrm{cmax}$ is coordinated with stomatal conductance [@joshi22natplants]. The simultaneous effects of $V_\mathrm{cmax}$ and $g_s$ are reflected by $\chi$. Therefore, @eq-optim-max can be expressed with respect to optimising $\chi$. Maximising a function is equivalent to finding the point where its first derivative (here with respect to $\chi$) is zero. [@prentice14ecollett] formulated such a similar (but not strictly equivalent) optimality criterion as
$$
\frac{\partial (E/A)}{\partial \chi} + \beta \frac{\partial (V_\mathrm{cmax}/A)}{\partial \chi} = 0 \;.
$$
$E/A$ is the unit cost of transpiration. $V_\mathrm{cmax}/A$ is the unit cost of carboxylation. Their sum is minimized here with respect to $\chi$. $\beta$ is the unit cost ratio. From this, the response of the stomatal conductance to $D$ and $A$ can be derived (not shown here, but in @stocker20gmd) as
$$
g_s = \left( 1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{D}} \right) \frac{A}{c_a - \Gamma^\ast}
$$
$g_1$ is a stomatal sensitivity parameter. Similar results are obtained with a related but not identical optimality criterion [@medlyn11gcb]. 

## From photosynthesis to light use efficiency {#sec-constlue}

The light use efficiency model (@eq-luemodel) and the FvCB model (@eq-aj and @eq-jmaxlim) represent a contrasting response of photosynthesis to light - linear in @eq-luemodel and saturating (by effects of a finite $J_\mathrm{max}$) in @eq-aj and @eq-jmaxlim. It should be noted that the LUE model describes the photosynthetic CO~2~ uptake at the canopy-level and for periods of multiple days to weeks (total GPP vs. total absorbed light). In contrast, the FvCB model describes the light-photosynthesis relationship at the leaf-level and in response to rapid changes in light (e.g., over the course of a day). 

As pointed out in @sec-fvcb, plants tend to coordinate the light and carboxylation-limited assimilation rates flexibly in response to average environmental conditions to which they are exposed while performing photosynthesis. Tending towards the co-limitation point can also be understood as an optimal functioning - avoiding overinvestment into maintaining a high maximum electron transport rate ($J_\mathrm{max}$) while being carboxylation-limited (too low $V_\mathrm{cmax}$), or the opposite. In other words, the higher the average light levels, the higher the maximum carboxylation capacity and therefore the amount of Rubisco in leaves. The linear relationship between GPP and PPFD in @eq-luemodel can be interpreted as an emerging relationship from the coordination of $A_C$ and $A_J$, and thus of $V_\mathrm{cmax}$ and $J_\mathrm{max}$. 

A very simple model, by which LUE is assumed to be constant over time and across ecosystems and using @eq-luemodel explains about 80% of observed GPP variations in data obtained from ecosystem flux measurements, as shown in @fig-gpp-constlue. In other words, variations in light (PPFD) and leaf area (measured by fAPAR) explain 80% of GPP variations over the seasons and across different locations on the globe.

## Exercise

Rising CO~2~ increases leaf-level photosynthesis. This sensitivity can be quantified using $\beta$ following @eq-beta. Calculate $\beta$ for the light-saturated photosynthesis rate (taking the equation for $A_C$), considering an increase in atmospheric CO~2~ from 400 to 600 ppm. Use $\Gamma^\ast = 3.3$ Pa, $K = 46$ Pa and $V_\mathrm{cmax} = 49 \; \mu$mol m^-2^ s^-1^. Note that $c_a$ in @eq-photo-fick is expressed in Pa. Convert an atmospheric CO~2~ concentration in units of ppm to Pa by multiplication with 0.101325 Pa ppm^-1^ (considering standard atmospheric pressure). Assume that the ratio of ambient-to-leaf-internal CO~2~ ($\chi$) remains constant at 0.7.

Compare your calculated $\beta$ of the light-saturated leaf-level photosynthesis rate with observations from Free Air CO~2~ Enrichment (FACE) experiments, as summarized by @ainsworth05. For this, download the paper [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01224.x) and find the reported value for the CO~2~ response of the light-saturated leaf-level photosynthesis rate. Convert the percentage increase reported by @ainsworth05 into a $\beta$ factor. Assume that on average, the CO~2~ levels in the FACE experiments were 350 ppm at ambient and 550 ppm at elevated levels.
