# Introduction

The Earth system can be regarded as a coupled system in which its elements (atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, biosphere, pedosphere, lithosphere) are interacting on various time scales. A primary goal of Earth System research is to understand the interactions occurring on time scales that are relevant for society in the context of anthropogenic climate change. It is now established with overwhelming evidence that anthropogenic CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels have caused a rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations beyond levels reached over the past 800,000 years, and that this concentration increase is the dominant driver of climate change as observed over the last decades.

The terrestrial biosphere - land - is at the core of the Earth system. It connects all spheres. Atmospheric humidity and near-surface heating of the atmosphere are determined by how much water vegetation transpires and how much radiation it reflects or absorbs. Its carbon balance determines the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere and thus affects the CO2 gas exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. The activity of plants is the driver for processes in the soil, the weathering of rocks. Any projection of climate change and climate impacts for the coming decades, centuries and millennia relies on an understanding of how the terrestrial biosphere responds and feeds back to climate and the Earth system. The carbon cycle of the terrestrial biosphere has a strong influence on how fast anthropogenic CO2 emissions will accumulate in the atmosphere. And it is through land ecosystems - both natural and agricultural - that climate impacts will be most clearly expressed. Understanding how climate influences the terrestrial biosphere is thus key to understanding climate impacts and projecting Earth system change.

This book focuses on the terrestrial biosphere, how its structure and functioning are shaped by climate, and how it affects atmospheric CO2 and climate change. The following set of phenomena and observations of current global environmental change impacts are an expression of the key role of the land in the Earth system. Over the course of this book, we will revisit these phenomena and observations and introduce the underlying processes and principles for understanding them. 

## Annual swings in atmospheric CO2

The longest-running record of direct measurements of atmospheric CO2 is from the Mauna Loa Observatory, atop a volcano on Hawaii. This record has become iconic for documenting the rapid rise of atmospheric CO2 - a greenhouse gas - since the great economic acceleration after the Second World War. This has provided a basis for understanding the relationship between emissions of anthropogenic CO2 and its accumulation in the atmosphere and for estimating the climate impact of this important greenhouse gas.

The time series in @fig-mauna-loa-co2 shows not only the accelerating rise in atmospheric CO2 over the past decades, but also its regular annual swings - the "breathing of the Earth". This is the result of the seasonal cycles in CO2 uptake and release by terrestrial ecosystems. CO2 uptake peaks in early early summer in the northern extratropics - driven by the high light availability and high photosynthetic rates of young leaves in the early summer months. CO2 release by respiring plants and soil microbes has a shifted seasonality and tends to have a smaller amplitude, compared to CO2 uptake. The net of the two drives changes in atmospheric CO2 which are measured here in the free atmosphere - unaffected by local anthropogenic sources - atop a volcano on Hawaii.

## Year-to-year changes of the global carbon budget

Anthropogenic carbon emissions in the form of CO2, resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels and from land use change, are partly taken up by the ocean and partly by terrestrial ecosystems. The remainder remains in the atmosphere and drives the atmospheric CO2 growth (see @fig-mauna-loa-co2). Each of these components gets estimated and updated each year as the [Global Carbon Budget](https://globalcarbonbudget.org/carbonbudget2023/). The latest scientific publication is @friedlingstein23essd.

Estimates of each compenent are largely independent and rely on different types of observations, data, and methods. Fossil emissions are based on energy statistics and cement production data, land use emissions are based on land-use and land-use change data and forest carbon "bookkeeping models". Atmospheric CO2 concentration, and hence the accumulation of C in the atmosphere, is measured directly. The ocean sink is estimated from global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based products. The land sink is estimated from dynamic global vegetation models @friedlingstein23essd.

This redistribution is governed carbon uptake by the ocean ('ocean sink') and carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems ('land sink'), while the remainder accumulates in the atmosphere ('atmospheric growth'). The dashed red line is mirrored from the solid red line and its difference to the blue line indicates the budget imbalance.

@fig-gcb_fig3 shows that the largest year-to-year variations in the redistribution of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is in the land sink component. While variations in the ocean sink and in emissions are relatively small, the carbon balance of the terrestrial biosphere varies strongly between years. This leads to substantial variations in annual atmospheric CO2 growth rate. Annual variations in the land C balance have been found to originate mostly from semi-arid regions, where large year-to-year variations in precipitation, often linked to El-Nino-Southern-Oscillation climate variability, alter water limitation of vegetation and drought-related disturbances, including fire activity [@ahlstroem15; @humphrey18nat]. This leads to large year-to-year variability in CO2 uptake and release by land ecosystems and leaves an imprint on the rise in atmospheric CO2. This also demonstrates the sensitivity of terrestrial C storage to climatic variations and that the response of the land biosphere to climate extremes can drastically alter the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere and thus the rate of climate change.
