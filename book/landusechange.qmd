<!-- From Zwyssig MSc thesis: land cover is defined as the (bio)physical attributes of the surface of the earth, e.g., degree of vegetation cover (Burkhard and Maes, 2017), and land use is defined as the human purpose or activities applied to these attributes, e.g., agriculture or recreation (Burkhard and Maes, 2017). Land cover often is derived using remote sensing (Nedd et al., 2021). Land use, however, cannot be derived directly from satellite images (Messerli et al., 2009). Land use/land cover change describes the temporal dynamics of land uses and land covers in the landscape (Lambin et al., 2001) -->
