Coming soon.

- Forests sustain the hydrologic cycle through evapotranspiration, which cools climate through feedbacks with clouds and precipitation
- Tropical forests:
  - "Observations show that forest transpiration is sustained during the dry season (11); this is seen also in CO2 fluxes (12) and satellite monitoring of vegetation (13, 14), to a greater extent than represented in many models."  (Bonan 2008)
- Material from trial lecture: lecture_et_giub.key
- Geographic patterns of evapotranspira- tion are explained by Budykoâ€™s analysis of the control of evapotranspiration by net radiation and precipitation.
