# Spatial and temporal patterns of the land carbon cycle {#sec-global-patterns}
 
Up to this point, we have considered the global terrestrial C cycle either as a 1-box model in @sec-gpp, or as a cascade of boxes in @sec-carboncycle_ecosystem. We have also learned in @sec-gpp and @sec-carboncycle_ecosystem how the CO~2~ assimilation and respiration fluxes depend on climatic variables. This implies the fluxes and pools of the terrestrial carbon cycle vary over the course of seasons and days and across geographical space - with different background climates. In this chapter, we delve into these spatial and temporal patterns of the land carbon cycle.

In @sec-gpp, the ecosystem-level photosynthetic CO~2~ assimilation flux, GPP, was described as a linear function of solar radiation (measured by PPFD), modified by the light use efficiency (LUE) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR). In @sec-constlue, we found that such a linear relationship (assuming a temporally constant and spatially uniform LUE) explains about 80% of the variations in GPP across sites and over time (aggregated data to weeks) in the dataset. Since GPP is the ultimate "engine" of the C cycle in terrestrial ecosystems and supplies C for all "downstream" fluxes and pools along the C cascade (@sec-ccascade), solar radiation is a major control of the terrestrial carbon cycle. @sec-solar-radiation explains how variations in PPFD received at the top of the canopy at a specific day-of-year and latitude depends on the geometry of how the Earth rotates around the sun. @sec-phenology introduces patterns and simple models for how phenology of vegetation greenness evolves. This focuses on leaf unfolding and shedding, with a focus on winter-dormant temperate and boreal biomes. Water stress-driven vegetation greenness changes will be introduced later. @sec-flux-variability will introduce how ecosystem fluxes vary over the seasons, while @sec-fluxepools-spatial will introduce how ecosystem fluxes and carbon pools vary spatially across the globe.
 
## Solar radiation {#sec-solar-radiation}

PPFD is a fraction of the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere ($I_\mathrm{TOA}$). This fraction depends on the planetary albedo for visible light ($\alpha_v$, unitless), an atmospheric attenuation factor ($\tau$, unitless) that accounts for the elevation ($z$)-dependent path length of a light ray travelling through the atmosphere and a factor that accounts for cloud cover $f_c$. A further reduction by about 50% arises because photosynthesis uses only a range of the spectrum of wavelengths of solar radiation, corresponding to the visible light spectrum. The factor $f_{p}$ accounts for this and for the conversion of $I_\mathrm{TOA}$, expressed as an energy flux in W m^-2^, to a flux of photons in mol s^-1^ m^-2^.
$$
\mathrm{PPFD} = (1-\alpha_{v})\; \tau(z, f_c) \; f_{p}  \; I_\mathrm{TOA}
$$ {#eq-ppfd}

Solar radiation across the full short-wave spectrum emitted by the sun and incident at the land surface (top-of-canopy, $I_\mathrm{0}$) is similarly related to $I_\mathrm{TOA}$. A different albedo applies for total short-wave radiation vs. the radiation in the photosynthetically active (and visible) spectrum. $I_\mathrm{0}$ is commonly expressed in energy units (W m^-2^).
$$
I_\mathrm{0} = (1-\alpha_\mathrm{sw})\; \tau(z, f_c) \; I_\mathrm{TOA}
$$ {#eq-sin}

### Solar geometry

Let's first step outside the atmosphere and focus on the solar geometry to understand $I_\mathrm{TOA}$. Solar geometry describes the cyclical movement of the Earth around the sun and how the resulting cyclically varying amount of solar energy that reaches the Earth. The top-of-the atmosphere perspective is relevant to separate atmospheric effects from planetary effects.

$I_\mathrm{TOA}$ scales in proportion with the solar constant $I_S$ (1360.8 W m^-2^) and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the Earth and the sun ($r_E$).
$$
I_\mathrm{TOA} = I_S r_E^{-2} \cos \theta_z
$$ {#eq-s-toa}
$\theta_z$ is the solar zenith angle. The term $\cos \theta_z$ accounts for the dependence of the solar radiation on the angle at which the sun's rays reach the Earth surface (no terrain considered). It varies cyclically over the course of a day (with *hour-of-day*) and over the course of a year (with *day-of-year*). The zenith angle is zero when the sun is directly above the observer - in the zenith (@fig-solar_geometry). At this point, the intensity of the solar radiation is at its maximum.

Note that $r_E$ is not constant over the course of a year as the Earth rotates around the sun not following a perfect circle but an ellipse.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-solar_geometry
#| fig-cap: ""
#| out-width: 80%
knitr::include_graphics("images/solar_geometry.png")
```

The dependence of the solar zenith angle on the hour-of-day, day-of-year, and the latitude is described by
$$
\cos \theta_z = \sin \varphi \sin \delta +\cos \varphi \cos \delta \cos h
$$ {#eq-solar-zenith-angle}

- $\varphi$ is the local latitude in radians (0 at the equator, $\pi/2$ at the poles)
- $\delta$ is the solar declination angle. It accounts for the tilt of the Earth relative to the plane in which it moves around the sun. It varies with the day-of-year ($23.5^\circ \pi/180$ on the northern-hemispheric summer solstice, June 21, and $-23.5^\circ \pi/180$ on the northern-hemispheric winter solstice, December 21)
- $h$ is the solar hour angle. It varies with the hour-of-day (0 at solar noon, $\pi$ at "solar midnight", $\pi/12$ at 1 hour after solar noon).

A derivation of @eq-solar-zenith-angle is given on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_zenith_angle).

The areas under the curves in @fig-zenith are proportional to the daily total solar radiation. Calculating daily totals involves a few integrals. The derivation is not shown here, but is explained in @davis17gmd. Daily totals and their variation over the seasons are shown below in @fig-daily_stoa and @fig-stoa_hovmoeller.

#| code-fold: true

#| fig-cap: "Daily total top-of-atmosphere solar radiation in J m^-2^. The summer solstice (21 June) is indicated by the dotted line. Note that the curves are not perfectly symmetrical with respect to the summer solstice line. This is because the Earth moves around the sun on an ellipse and hence the distance between the Earth and the sun varies over the year. The distance is at its minimum near the southern-hemispheric summer solstice. Therefore, the mid-summer maximum solar radiation at the southern tropic (23.5° S) is slightly higher than the mid-summer maximum solar radiation at the northern tropic (23.5° N)."

The diurnal (over the course of a day) and seasonal patterns in top-of-atmosphere solar radiation, following from solar geometry and expressed through @eq-solar-zenith-angle, have direct consequences for CO~2~ uptake patterns, as expressed through @eq-luemodel, @eq-ppfd, and @eq-s-toa and described further in @sec-global-patterns.

Some features are particularly noteworthy about the patterns in $I_\mathrm{TOA}$:

- The diurnal variation of the instantaneous flux is largest in the tropics.
- The seasonal variation of the daily total flux is largest at the north pole.
- At the summer solstice, the daily total solar radiation is largest at the north pole, ...
- ... but the daily maximum instantaneous and the daytime mean radiation flux are lower at the north pole than at the equator at the summer solstice.

The biology of plants is attuned to the solar radiation patterns across different latitudes. The photosynthetic apparatus is constructed to make best use of the light, even during the hours of peak light intensity at mid-day. The phenological phases of plant growth reflect the light distribution over the seasons - evergreen plants dominate in the moist tropics to make use of the light year-round, while deciduous leaf strategies and annual life history strategies dominate in the northern latitudes where the seasonal fluctuation of light is large.

### Long-term variations in solar radiation

*Solar irradiance*

The solar constant $I_S$ isn't actually constant but varies on the order of 0.1% of the course of a *solar cycle*. One cycle is approximately 11 years. The cyclic behavior is related to the periodic flip of the sun's magnetic field and the number of sunspots. The radiation emitted from the sun and the number of sunspots are at their minimum after a magnetic flip. There is also a small long-term trend in the solar radiation, having increased by <0.1% since the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715). Solar irradiance is measured at high altitude to minimize the influence of the atmosphere ($\tau$ in Eq. @eq-ppfd) and get information about how $I_S$ varies. Reconstructions of solar irradiance changes for the pre-instrumental period are based on the relationship between $I_S$ and the (easily observable) sunspot number. Variations in $I_S$ are small and do not have a dominant effect on climate and the carbon cycle that would override other forcings, especially for the industrial period [@IPCC_2021_WGI_SPM].

*Volcanic activity*

Volcanic eruptions can influence the solar radiation at the Earth surface. Events that reduce solar radiation by more than 1 W m^-2^ occur approximately every 35-40 years [@IPCC_2021_WGI_Ch_2] and affect climate and the carbon cycle for up to a few years after very large eruptions. The increased aerosol load in the atmosphere reduces the total radiative energy flux (reducing $\tau$ in Eq. @eq-ppfd). However, through the strong positive effect of the aerosol load on the share of diffuse versus direct radiation, volcanic aerosols can affect the terrestrial carbon cycle, (somehow surprisingly) leading to a greater land C sink following years of large volcanic eruptions (@sec-light-absorption).

*Orbital parameters*

The largest changes in $I_\mathrm{TOA}$ arise over millennial time scales and are related to variations in Earth's orbit around the sun. These *Milankovic cycles* are the trigger for the large climate swings between ice ages and warm periods over the course of ~100,000 years. Variations in the orbital parameters affect the latitudinal and seasonal distribution of $I_\mathrm{TOA}$. Orbital parameters that vary periodically are:

- The *eccentricity* of the Earth's elliptical orbit which affects the distance between the Earth and the sun, affecting $I_\mathrm{TOA}$ via $r_E$ in @eq-s-toa. It varies with a period of approximately 100,000 years.
- The *obliquity* - the tilt of the axis of the Earth's own rotation relative to the plane in which the Earth rotates around the sun. A greater obliquity amplifies seasonal variations in $I_\mathrm{TOA}$. The obliquity is currently at 23.44°. At its minimum, it's at 21.1°. Obliquity varies over 41,000 years.
- The *precession* is the rotation of the Earth's own rotation axis itself. The effect of precession, in combination with the fact that the Earth's orbit is elliptical, is that the variation of the sun-Earth distance shifts over the seasons. It varies with a period of about 25,700 years.

The point of minimal distance coinciding with the summer solstice leads to the largest mid-summer radiation maximum. As a result, the incident solar radiation over the northern-hemispheric summer at 65°N varied by about 83 W m^-2^ during the past million years. These changes are much larger than the ones driven by solar irradiance and volcanic activity.

About 6000 years ago, during the *Mid-Holocene Warm Period*, a summer maximum insolation for the northern hemisphere was reached (@fig-stoa_hovmoeller_holo). During this period, temperatures and solar irradiance during the growing season were elevated relative to the pre-industrial period and precipitation patterns shifted. This had profound effects on vegetation and the carbon cycle. Testimony to this change are reconstructions that document a "Green Sahara" and a northward shift temperate and boreal forest biomes [@macdonald00qr; @prentice00biome] during this period.
