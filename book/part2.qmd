# Part II

In Part I of this book, processes of the land biosphere and the exchanges of water and energy through land surface processes were introduced. In Part II, we take the perspective from the Earth system. Additional land biosphere processes will be introduced, but now with a focus on how they affect climate and the carbon cycle under global environmental change. Part II builds on the contents introduced in Part I and connects the process understanding developed therein with the current research frontier for understanding global change impacts on the land biosphere, climate, and the Earth system.
